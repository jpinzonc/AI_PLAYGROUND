Great white shark\\n2. Tiger shark\\n3. Hammerhead shark\\n4. Bull shark\\n5. Oceanic whitetip shark\\n6. Lemon shark\\n7. Blacktip shark\\n\\nSharks play a vital role in the ocean ecosystem, serving as apex predators and helping to maintain the balance of marine ecosystems.\\n\\nI hope this gives you a good introduction to what sharks are!'"
