Introduction\\nElectronic supplementary material is available online at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.\\nSymbioses profoundly influence the diversity, ecology, and evolution of life on Earth.\\nIn particular, mutualisms function through reciprocal exploitation that ultimately provides net benefits to each partner, with the resulting functionality of the unit constrained to the attributes of each partner.\\nReefbuilding corals depend on nutrients translocated from endosymbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellates in the family Symbiodiniaceae for survival © 2023 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.\\nAll rights reserved.\\nand growth.\\nNumerous different host–symbiont combinations exhibit a wide breadth of functional diversity important to the persistence and resiliency of the ecosystems they construct [1–3].\\nNotably, the sensitivity of reef-building corals to acute environmental stressors including prolonged and/or extreme periods of irradiance and/or temperature stress is influenced by the identity and physiology of their dinoflagellate partner [2,4–7].\\nCorals hosting symbionts that maintain physiological function under such conditions have reduced symbiont cell loss (coral bleaching), less mortality, and faster recoveries [1,8–11].\\nA body of evidence suggests that the costs of thermal tolerance manifest as reduced nutrient translocation [12–15] and significant negative physiological tradeoffs to the host coral such as reduced growth and fecundity [16–18], although some findings contradict this perception [19–23].\\nWhile partner specificity is largely intrinsic to most coral– dinoflagellate mutualisms, the fidelity between host and symbiont is partially influenced by prevailing environmental conditions, and why thermal history and light availability often explains the dominance of certain host-compatible symbionts over others [24,25].\\nPartner specificity is especially magnified in coral taxa where symbionts are transferred during egg maturation (vertical acquisition or transmission) [26,27].\\nContrary to horizontal transmission (symbiont acquired from the environment), vertical transmission reinforces the maintenance of certain host–symbiont combinations for generations, leading to ecological (host habitat) specialization by the symbiont [28].\\nYet, vertical transmission only occurs in several, albeit widespread and ecologically successful, host taxa including members of the genera Porites and Montipora, as well as corals in the family Pocilloporidae.\\nIn some cases, these co-evolved host–symbiont pairings may have greater functional integration compared to associations reliant on horizontal transmission [22].\\nThe first reports that related differential colony mortality to the identity of the resident symbiont originated in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) following the 1997–1998 El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event when water temperatures were 2–4°C warmer than historical average temperatures [1].\\nPocillopora grandis colonies that hosted Durusdinium glynnii remained pigmented during this thermal anomaly and experienced little to no mortality, while colonies that bleached contained Cladocopium latusorum as did colonies of P. verrucosa (presumably) with Cladocopium pacificum [1,29].\\nThis differential response to environmental stressors was later confirmed when 90% of P. grandis colonies containing C. latusorum and just 10% of colonies with D. glynnii visibly bleached during cold-water events in 2007 and 2008 [30,31].\\nThus, the greater stress tolerance of colonies with D. glynnii mostly explains the relative dominance of this host–symbiont combination across the Eastern Pacific tropical and sub-tropical coasts of North and Central America [1,9,32,33].\\nThe Eastern Pacific is an ideal study system to compare how different symbionts can affect the functionality of an ecologically dominant coral.\\nPocillopora grandis with either D. glynnii or C. latusorum, occur at similar depths and in many of the same habitats, with few colonies containing mixtures of each symbiont [9,34,35].\\nHere, the functional performance of both partnerships was studied under normal conditions and during a thermal stress experiment.\\nCritical attributes of these mutualisms, including symbiont cell densities and division rates, photophysiology, colony\\ngrowth, calcification, calyx dimensions and fecundity were examined to evaluate how different symbiont species affect the host animal’s well-being and reveal possible metabolic trade-offs associated with thermal tolerance.\\n2. Methods\\n(a) Colony sampling and transect configuration for symbiont species identification, ecological prevalence and within-host abundance\\nThree independent sampling methods were conducted to sample colonies of Pocillopora grandis, also referred to in the literature using the junior synonym P. eydouxi.\\nThis is the only genetically verified Pocillopora species found along Mexico’s Pacific coastline [36].\\nIn 2004, during an initial biodiversity survey, 129 colonies were sampled using a hammer and chisel from various habitats at depths of 1–8 m in the Gulf of California region around La Paz.\\nAt Punta Galeras Reef (24° 21.2567 N, 110° 17.0833 W) and La Gaviota Island (24° 17.2 N; 110° 20.3333 W) three 25 m long linear permanent transects were established at each location in May 2006 as described in LaJeunesse et al., [34] where 18–24 tagged colonies were sampled per transect (122 total).\\nLastly, three 20 m diameter circular/polar plot surveys (greater than 30 m apart) at Punta Galeras Reef and three at La Gaviota Island were conducted to randomly sample colonies in a circular area according to Baums et al.\\n[37] (118 colonies total) [37].\\nSymbiont species were identified by DGGE-ITS2/ITS1 profiling and sequencing as described in [27,34,38].\\nEach sample used was sequenced following each field season-sampling/experimental timepoint- providing a total of 595 of samples.\\nThe symbiont identity in colonies used for all experiments was confirmed using the same methods.\\n(b) Symbiont cell sizes, mitotic indices, and densities\\nTissue was removed from branch fragments representing each of seven colonies containing C. latusorum and nine colonies with where a, b, and c is equal to half the length,width and height (equal to width), respectively.\\nD. glynnii in July 2007 (colonies were from the established transects with known symbiont species).\\nOne ml of tissue slurry was preserved with 10uL of 10% glutaraldehyde.\\nSymbiont cell sizes were measured at 400× on an Olympus Bx61 compound microscope (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with the ORCA ER (Model C4742-80) andOlympusDP71 at the Penn StateMicroscopy Facility.\\nThe maximum length and width of at least 50 cells per colony were measured using ImageJ.\\nAverage ellipsoid cell volume was calculated using the formula,\\nV\\n¼\\n4\\n3 P abc\\nMaximum cell division time was estimated by collecting cells every three hours from 03.30 to 21.30 from polyps 1.5–2 cm below the branch tips of three different Pocillopora colonies (genets) containing D. glynnii and three colonies containing C. latusorum in July 2007.\\nSymbiont cells were isolated from host tissues with a pipette tip to remove and macerate 1–2 polyps.\\nThe slurry was placed in a 0.5 ml Eppendorf tube and fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde.\\nCell number and dividing cells (recorded as doublets and tetrads) were recorded with a haemocytometer (the cells in each of the three 10 µl sub-samples were counted).\\nThe mitotic index was calculated by dividing the number of dividing cells by the total cells present [39].\\nSymbiont densities were estimated by removing tissue from 8 coral fragments (four fragments each for C. latusorum and D. glynnii) with a WaterPik and filtered seawater (0.4 µm) in July 2007 [40].\\nThe tissue slurry volume was recorded, and symbiont cells were counted using a haemocytometer on a light microscope.\\nThe hot wax method [41] was used to measure coral surface area, as described in detail in [9].\\nTotal symbiont-to-host biomass ratios were calculated by multiplying the average symbiont cell volume by the average symbiont cell densities per host tissue area.\\n(c) Relative colony fecundity\\nDuring July 2008, nearing the first peak in Pocillopora grandis spawning in the Gulf of California [42], three fragments each from six tagged colonies with D. glynnii and seven colonies with C. latusorum were collected using a hammer and chisel and preserved in 10% seawater formalin.\\nFragments were then decalcified in 10% hydrochloric acid for 24 h and embedded in paraffin wax.\\nCoral tissue was sectioned (10 µm) with a microtome, and six slides were used per fragment with each containing three to five sections approximately 0.5 cm below the growing tip and three to five sections approximately 0.5 cm above the base of the fragment.\\nSlide images were recorded on an Olympus Bx61 microscope (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with the ORCA ER (Model C4742-80) and Olympus DP71 at the Penn State Microscopy Facility.\\nOocytes with a visible, stained nucleus (indicating the centre and the maximum diameter of the oocyte) were photographed, and the maximum Ferret diameter of each oocyte was measured using ImageJ.\\nSeparately, the number of oocytes and spermaries from three randomly selected, cross-sectional polyps per slide were counted and used as a proxy for relative fecundity.\\n(d) Host growth, calcification, linear extension and calyx dimensions\\nOne fragment per colony from 6 colonies containing C. latusorum and 5 colonies with D. glynnii were collected in May 2010 and maintained in outdoor seawater flow-through tables at 26°C under a shade cloth providing a maximal mid-day irradiance of approximately 400 µmol quanta m−2 s−1.\\nInstantaneous rates of calcification were measured following the procedure from Yao and Byrne 1998 [43] which is based on the alkalinity anomaly technique wherein each molar equivalent reduction in total alkalinity of seawater corresponds to one precipitated mole of CaCO3 [44,45].\\nEach fragment was incubated for one hour in 200 ml acrylic chambers containing 0.45 µm filtered seawater with a stir bar and held at a constant temperature of 25.5°C ± 0.5 with 400 µm quanta m−2s−1 from 6W pure white LED bulbs.\\nThe instantaneous calcification rate was calculated by spectrophotometrically measuring the change in total alkalinity of seawater of the incubation seawater using an Ocean Optics USB4000 spectrophotometer (Ocean Insight, Orlando Fl.).\\nIn June 2008, coral growth was recorded by buoyant weight [46] by collecting and initially weighing fragments from 33 colonies containing D. glynnii and 44 colonies containing C. latusorum.\\nFragments were mounted on 1.500 PVC couplers and were subsequently attached to the reef and then collected and reweighed four months later in October 2008 and one year later in June 2009.\\nDNA was extracted from each fragment and analysed to identify symbiont species after the last weight measurement.\\nCoral branch linear extension was determined in situ over the course of eight months from October 2008 to June 2009.\\nA plastic band was placed on four randomly selected branches approximately 50 cm near the centre of 10 colonies containing D. glynnii and 10 colonies containing C. latusorum, and the distance from the band to the branch tip was measured.\\nThe band-to-branch length was again measured in June 2009 for all\\nexcept 5 D. glynnii colonies, which were removed from the analysis as half of the banded branches were lost from the colony.\\nDNA was extracted and analysed to identify symbiont species at the end of the experiment.\\nFive calices were randomly selected for measurement from five previously collected, genotyped, and photographed colonies containing C. latusorum and 15 containing D. glynnii.\\nThe maximum and minimum diameters of each calyx cup and the distance to the nearest calyx were measured using ImageJ.\\n(e) Experimental thermal stress and photophysiology\\nAs described in detail in [31], tagged P. grandis colonies containing C. latusorum andD.\\nglynniiwere collected from 3–5 m and brought back into shaded seawater flow-through tanks at Universidad Autónoma de Baja California Sur in July 2007, which received a similar maximal mid-day irradiance as that recorded on the reef (approx. 950–1000 µmol photons m−2 s−1).\\nTwelve host fragments per symbiont species were mounted using marine epoxy onto 1.500 PVC couplers, divided and placed into control tanks, and maintained at 26°C for 36 h for a short acclimation period.\\nIn the experimental tanks, temperature was increasingly ramped 1.5°C per day until reaching 32°C and then held at 32°C for 7 more days, while control tanks remained at 26°C for the entirety of the experiment.\\nDuring acclimation and throughout the experiment, single-turnover active chlorophyll a fluorescence was monitored with a fluorescence induction and relaxation (FIRe) fluorometer fitted with a fibre optic probe (Satlantic).\\nAfter dark acclimating fragments for 20 min, a 120 µs saturation light pulse was applied.\\nFluorescence kinetics were averaged from ten fluorescence induction curves (n = 10) and were fit to a biophysical model [47] in order to calculate the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II, Fv/Fm, as (Fm− Fo)/Fm = Fv/Fm), as well as the PSII functional absorption cross-section (σPSII) which is a measure of photon capture efficiency and is indicative of the ability to absorb and use light, and the reoxidation rate of photosystem II (PSII) (τ), which indicates the speed atwhich electrons aremoving between primary and secondary quinones in PSII.\\nDecreased photosynthetic efficiency, slowed reoxidation rates, and larger σPSII are often observed with thermal/light stress [6,22,23,49,48].\\nAfter 24 h at either control (26°C) or treatment (32°C), symbiont cells were isolated and the mitotic index was quantified during maximum cell division.\\n(f) Data analysis\\nAll data were checked for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test and qqplots.\\nWhere the assumption of normality was not met, non-parametric tests were used to test deviations from null hypotheses.\\nDuring the high-temperature experiment, Fv/Fm, σPSII, τ, and mitotic indices were compared using the linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) using the lme4 package [50], with fixed effects including symbiont species, day, and treatment, and random effect of the fragment, to assess the influence of symbiont species and thermal exposure (28° or 32°C) andduration (1–7 days) on a colony’s photophysiology.\\nPairwise post hoc comparisons were performed using the ‘emmeans’ package [51].\\nCell densities were normalized to a regression-based standard curve of host tissue surface areas and total densities and cell sizes were compared using Student’s t-test.\\nBuoyant weights were tested with LMMs with fixed effects of symbiont species, time, and random effect of the fragment, with post hoc comparisons as previously described.\\nInstantaneous calcification rates were analysed using Student’s t-test.\\nThe non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to analyse branch linear extension, oocyte size, relative fecundity, as well as calyx diameters and distances to the nearest neighbour calyx.\\nMetric means and standard deviations are reported.\\nFor each test, outliers were removed and re-analysed, with deviations from the interpretations noted.\\n(b)(a) (c)\\n0180\\n270 20\\n10\\nFigure 1.\\nPocillopora grandis colonies in the Eastern Pacific predominately host

Results\\n(a) High prevalence of colonies housing thermally tolerant D. glynnii and rare detection of symbiont mixtures.\\nUsing three different sampling approaches,D.\\nglynniiwasmost prevalent in a majority of P. grandis colonies (figure 1a–c).\\nDifferences in the prevalence of colonies with C. latusorum ranged from 6–34% which differed from location to location, mode of sampling, and year.\\nColonies with mixtures of each symbiont were typically rare (≤5%), but highest in areas where colonies with C. latusorum were most common (approx. 15% of colonies; figure 1b).\\nThe co-occurrence of both host–symbiont pairing allowed for the comparison of their phenotypic and physiological attributes (figure 2a).\\n(b) Total volumes of the symbiont populations were generally equivalent for each host–symbiont combination\\nThemean cell sizes (width and length) ofD.\\nglynniiwere smaller than C. latusorum (figure 2b).\\nThe mean cell volumes calculated for D. glynnii were therefore significantly smaller than C. latusorum (p < 0.001) (table 1).\\nMean D. glynnii cell densities were greater than the cell densities of C. latusorum (p= 0.006; figure 2c; table 1).\\nThe marked difference in cell volume when combined with cell density differences in the host, results in equivalent average symbiont volume per area of host tissue;\\n18.61 for colonies with D. glynnii and 18.41 with C. latusorum.\\n(c) Cell division rates differed diurnally and seasonally\\nOver a 24-h sampling cycle in July, cell division rates for both species were highest 1–3 h after sunrise (figure 2d).\\nThe same peak division time was confirmed in January (data not shown).\\nThis diurnal peak in cell division (mitotic index) was twice as high (6% versus 3%) for D. glynnii than C. latusorum in the summer (July) (figure 2d).\\nHowever, in the winter, the peak mitotic index increased significantly for C. latusorum while it was significantly decreased for D. glynnii to the extent that peak per cent cell division was higher for C. latusorum than D. glynnii (5% versus 3%; p < 0.001f; figure 3d; table 2).\\n(d) Oocyte size, not fecundity, differed among host–symbiont pairings\\nFecundity (figure 2e), estimated as the average number of gametes (oocytes and spermaries) per polyp, was similar between the superior (approx. 2 cm from tip) and inferior (6–8 cm from tip) positions of each coral branch examined regardless of the symbiont hosted (p > 0.31; table 1).\\nMoreover, fecundity was similar between each host–symbiont combination (p > 0.1; figure 2f; table 1).\\nOocyte size ranges followed a bimodal distribution in all colonies (figure 2g), corresponding to different early stages in oocyte development (i.e. I–III) as well as for mature oocytes (stage IV).\\nColonies with C. latusorum had larger oocytes than colonies with D. glynnii (p < 0.001; figure 2g; table 1).\\n(e) Biomass increase, calcification rates, linear extension as well as calyx cup sizes and distance of separation were equivalent between host–symbiont pairings\\nMean buoyant weights of small out-planted experimental colonies increased 40% after 6 months and 260% after one year (p < 0.001).\\nThere was no statistical difference in weight gain between colonies with D. glynnii or C. latusorum (p > 0.93; figure 2h; table 1).\\nLikewise, branches with either D. glynnii or C. latusorum calcified at the same rate (p = 0.12; figure 2i; table 1) and branch linear extension of large adult colonies in situ was similar after eight months (p = 0.17; figure 2j; table 1).\\nAverage calyx sizes between colonies with D. glynnii or C. latusorum were also similar (p = 0.053) as was the distance between nearest calices (p = 0.78; table 1; electronic supplementary material, figure S1).\\n(f) Colonies with D\\nf) Colonies with D. glynnii tolerated high temperatures, while colonies with C. latusorum underwent photoinactivation No photophysiological differences were observed in the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), functional absorption cross section (σPSII) or rate of reoxidation (τ) in control or heat treatment colonies hostingD.\\nglynnii (p > 0.2; figure 3a,b; table 2).\\nThese variables did not change in C. latusorum control colonies besides having slower reoxidation rates (τ) by day 6 of the experiment (p< 0.004; table 2).\\nHowever, Fv/Fm declined significantly in heat-treated C. latusorum colonies beginning on day 3 of the experiment (p= 0.01; table 2) and continued until day 7 (p 0.001; table 2).\\nThe σPSII increased by day 3\\n(b) (c) (d )\\n10\\n5\\n7 4 12 6 3\\n0 summer winter developing oocytes (stages I–III) mature oocytes (stage IV)\\n\\n |  | 0\\n | --- | ---\\n | 0 | 0 | 30 | 60 | 90\\n | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---\\n |  | 5\\n | 10 | 4 32 21\\n | 8\\n | 1\\n | 0 0 8 10 12 146 cell width (�m) 2 0.03 (e) (f) (g) 7.5 0.04\\n | * *\\n | 5.0\\n | 20 60\\n | 0.02\\n | 1 2.5 0.01\\n | 80 100\\n | oocyte diameter (�m)\\n\\n(a) (i) ( j) *\\n*\\n* (h)\\n*\\n*\\n* 1.25 40 30\\n600\\n1.00\\n400 20 0.75\\n10 200 0.50 0 0.25\\nD. glynnii C. latusorum\\n0 6 mo 1 yr Figure 2.\\nEmergent properties of co-evolved host–symbiont mutualisms.\\n(a) Analyses of two host–symbiont combinations conducted at different biological scales ranging from cellular dynamics of the dinoflagellate symbiont (top), fecundity at the polyp scale (middle), to colony-scale growth rates (bottom).\\nColonies of Pocillopora grandis dominated by Durusdinium glynnii appear yellow-orange, while colonies with Cladocopium latusorum appear brownish.\\n(b) Cell dimensions (length and width) of C. latusorum are larger than those of D. glynnii (large symbols represent mean dimensions of cells obtained from independent colonies), (c) Cell densities in host tissues were different for colonies with C. latusorum (brown) or D. glynnii (yellow-orange) (p = 0.006).\\n(d) Each symbiont exhibited diurnal oscillation in mitotic indices with peak division rates 1–3 h after sunrise (grey shading = night).\\nSummer-time cell division rates (proportion of dividing cells to the total number of cells) measured over a 24-hour period for C. latusorum and D. glynnii.\\nInset shows significant differences in peak mitotic indices in the summer (S) versus the winter season (W) for each symbiont species.\\n(e) Histological transverse cross-section of polyp showing mesenteries (M), oocytes (Ooc), oocyte nuclei (N), oocyte nucleolus (NU), and spermaries (SP).\\n(f) Average number of oocytes (left, p = 0.52) and spermaries (right, p = 0.1) per polyp for P. grandis with C. latusorum or D. glynnii, respectively.\\n(g) Bi-modal size distribution of developing (stages I–III) and mature (stage IV) oocytes.\\nOocytes in colonies with D. glynnii were smaller for each developmental stage (p < 0.001).\\n(h) Increases in buoyant weights at 6 months and one year (p > 0.93), (i) instantaneous calcification rates (p = 0.12), and (j) linear branch extension (p = 0.17) were similar between colonies with each symbiont species.\\nError bars represent one standard deviation.\\n(p = 0.02;

Discussion\\n(a) The functional convergence of different host– symbiont combinations\\n(i) Mutualisms converged on a functionally stable and productive unit\\nThe similarities in growth as well as gamete production, seen here, indicate that colonies derive similar metabolic benefits from hosting evolutionarily divergent symbionts (figure 2).\\nThe steady-state condition, or phenotype, of P. grandis with each symbiont species is noticeably distinct.\\nYet the emergent effect of each combination produces functionally similar mutualisms under normal environmental conditions.\\nWhile colonies with C. latusorum have considerably fewer symbiont cells per surface area, this difference is compensated by the greater C. latusorum cell size relative to D. glynnii (figure 2b).\\nTherefore, the total standing biomass of each resident symbiont population is nearly equivalent and partially explains the similarities in attributes related to colony growth and reproduction.\\nWhile estimates of nutrient translocation were beyond the scope of this study, independent research recently determined that colonies with D. glynnii received considerable nutrient inputs from this symbiont [23].\\nTaken together, these findings emphasize high functionality in different mutualisms, especially in ones that are co-evolved [22,23].\\nTable 1.\\nSummary statistics

combination (figure 2h–j).\\nThis variability is typical for most corals and is probably influenced by genotypic differences, phenotypic plasticity, microenvironmental conditions and some combination of these factors [11,52].\\nHowever, these inter-colony variabilities were remarkably similar for each mutualism, showing no differences in any growth measurements (figure 2h–j, electronic supplementary material, figure S1).\\nThe only biological metric that indicated a physiological discrepancy between each mutualistic combination was the difference in mean egg sizes.\\nWhile relative fecundity did not differ between colonies with either symbiont (figure 2f), at the July sampling, colonies withD.\\nglynnii had slightly smaller oocytes than colonies harbouring C. latusorum (figure 2g).\\nThis observation is similar to previous findings where egg size and number appeared uncorrelated [17,52].\\nBecause this incongruity may be explained by differences in the timing of oocyte maturation, additional temporal sampling is needed to assess whether this difference remained constant throughout oocyte maturation and spawning.\\nUltimately, tracking fertilization success, larval survivorship and settlement rate is required to determine whether egg number and size represent accurate proxies for colony health and reproductive fitness.\\nIn some studies, coral oocyte sizes correlated positively with energy reserves, such as lipids [53], and was assumed to be indicative animal’s energetic health [17], but other studies found that larger, more developed, oocytes do not always correlate with higher lipid concentrations [54].\\nDifferences in oocyte sizemayaffect dispersal success to near and/or distant habitats [55].\\nThus, size variation could be advantageous in some situations and increase the probability of survival in unpredictable environments [56].\\n(a)\\n | heat experiment |  | \\n | --- | --- | ---\\n | 26ºC 32ºC |  | \\n | ramp treatment 32º\\n |

C. latusorum (bleached) versus those with D. glynnii (pigmented) after cold water anomaly in 2007 and 2008.\\n(ii) Differences in seasonal acclimatization\\nWater temperatures and day length oscillate substantially between summer and winter in the Gulf of California [57].\\nChanges in these physical conditions appear to differentially affect cell division rates of C. latusorum and D. glynnii.\\nWith each species having different thermal and light optima for growth, seasonal differences in resource availability likely influence cell proliferation [58,59].\\nAdditionally, differences between symbiont species in cell size and in hospite densities likely regulate their acquisition of inorganic nutrients, which may alter their physiological condition [60].\\nHowever, while seasonal cell division differed between these symbionts, Pettay et al.\\n[61] and McGinley et al.\\n[31,62] found their intra-colony dominance remained stable in tagged colonies during and after thermal stress events [61,62].\\nMost colonies are overwhelmingly dominated by one symbiont, with the other species often detected at trace levels (less than 1% of total symbiont cells in a colony; figure 1) [62].\\nNot only does one symbiont species persist [30,34,62], this stability often extends to the symbiont’s genotype or clonal cell line.\\nWhile rapid shifts in symbiont dominance sometimes occur in a subset of Pocillopora colonies (less than 5%), shifts were random, not favouring a particular symbiont over the other, and noted only after a stressful cold-water episode [62].\\nTable 2.\\nComparisons of seasonal mitotic indices (MI), per cent change in buoyant weights after six months and one year, as well as measures during the thermal experiment of MI, Fv/Fm, σPSII

personal observation).\\nThe adaptive radiation of Durusdinium in the Indo-West Pacific during the Pleistocene led to the evolution of numerous ecologically specialized species like D. glynnii that maintain stable associations with specific host taxa [11,25,65].\\nMoreover, facilitated by vertical transmission, pocilloporid corals share a close evolutionary history with their symbionts, which further explains their high-functioning mutualism with D. glynnii [26,71].\\nThese evolutionary factors reconcile the present findings with previous reports of significant growth trade-offs among corals with thermally tolerant symbionts [15–17].\\nPrevious reports of growth tradeoffs are context dependent and possibly explained by different factors, including the geographical location and species identity of the Durusdinium under study.\\nJuvenile Acropora colonies experienced almost 50% reduced growth (measured as the number of new polyps added over time) when associated with Durusdinium sp.\\non the Great Barrier Reef [16].\\nMoreover, adult colonies had 25–30% fewer lipid stores and smaller oocytes than colonies harbouring Cladocopium spp.\\n[17].\\nLower rates of translocated photosynthate accounts for the reduced growth, lowenergy reserves and smaller oocyte sizesmeasured in these GBR Acropora colonies [15].\\nThe Acropora-Durusdinium combinations found on the GBR are rare, however, and occur in the most marginal of reef habitats [15–17,72,73], indicating that the environments of this reef system do not readily support mutualisms involving this genus of symbiont.\\nSimilarly, Caribbean Orbicella colonies hosting Durusdinium trenchii exhibit approximately 50% lower calcification rates ([18], but see also [74]), have lower tissue biomass, and fewer nutrient reserves (D. W. Kemp 2023, personal communication).\\nHowever, D. trenchii is a non-native species recently introduced from the Indo-Pacific [18].\\nUltimately, earlier characterizations of poor growth seem to relate to rare or introduced species of Durusdinium, representing maladapted mutualisms lacking a coevolutionary history.\\nArguably, physiological performance is expected to be optimized in host corals like Pocilloporawhich have coevolved for hundreds of thousands to millions of years with symbionts in the genus Durusdinium [25].\\nAs research expands to more tropical warm-water regions of the Indo-Pacific, these host–symbiont pairings do not appear to experience reduced translocation or calcification (D. W. Kemp et al. 2023, unpublished data).\\nD. glynnii in Pocillopora supports high rates of photosynthesis per cell and maintains carbon translocation under higher temperature [23].\\nIndeed, a clearer understanding of the natural history of reef corals and their symbionts, including the discernment of closely related symbiont species, is necessary to better explain physiological and ecological patterns and processes.\\n(d) Host dependency on co-evolved symbionts in a changing climate\\nThese findings provide insight into the persistence of reef corals as oceans continue to warm and marine heat waves increase in frequency [75,76].\\nBecause certain symbiont species raise the thermal tolerance of host corals by 1–2°C, different host–symbiont partner combinations induce phenotypic change faster than evolutionary adaptation.\\nThis ecological response is limited by partner specificity and symbiont availability [6,77–79], however, many stress-tolerant symbionts, including D. glynnii, are widespread throughout the IndoPacific [65,66].\\nIn some mutualisms, harbouring symbionts with physiological adaptations that allow tollerance to high temperatures can result in metabolic tradeoffs affecting colony growth and fitness.\\nBy contrast, the physiological inte- gration between co-evolved mutualisms, like Pocillopora and D. glynnii, creates fast-growing, highly fecund, colonies with few observable trade-offs.\\nThe larger implications of these findings are numerous.\\nIncreased prevalence of these mutualisms under higher or more variable ocean temperatures may continue to support ecosystem productivity and contribute to reef growth [33].\\nFuture comprehensive analyses, such as the present case study, will offer better insights into the functional ecology of coral–dinoflagellate mutualisms and how partner diversity in these relationships creates important variation critical in their responses to climate change.\\nData accessibility.\\nAll data are provided in the online electronic supplementary material, which is deposited in Dryad: https://doi.\\norg/10.5061/dryad.b8gtht7j0 [80].\\nAll R code used in analyses are available via github at the following link: https://github.com/KiraTurnham/Pocillopora-thermal-tolerance.\\nAdditional information is provided in electronic supplementary material [81].\\nAuthors’ contributions.\\nK.E.T.\\n: data curation, formal analysis, investigation, methodology, project administration, resources, software, validation, visualization, writing—original draft, writing—review and editing; M.D.A.\\n: data curation, investigation, methodology, validation, writing—review and editing; D.T.P.\\n: data curation, investigation, methodology, validation, writing—review and editing; D.A.P.-G.\\n: investigation, methodology, validation, writing—review and editing; H.R.-B.\\n: investigation, methodology, resources; J.P.\\n: data curation, funding acquisition, investigation, methodology, validation, writing—review and editing; E.T.\\n: data curation, validation; R.T.S.\\n: data curation, investigation, methodology, validation, writing—review and editing; M.P.M.\\n: data curation, investigation, methodology, validation, writing—review and editing; M.E.W.\\n: conceptualization, data curation, funding acquisition, investigation, methodology, project administration, resources, supervision, validation, writing—review and editing; T.C.L.\\n: conceptualization, data curation, funding acquisition, investigation, methodology, project administration, resources, software, supervision, validation, visualization, writing—original draft, writing—review and editing.\\nAll authors gave final approval for publication and agreed to be held accountable for the work performed therein.\\nConflict of interest declaration.\\nWe declare we have no competing interests.\\nFunding.\\nThis research was funded by the National Science Foundation (grant no.

Introduction\\nElectronic supplementary material is available online at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.\\nSymbioses profoundly influence the diversity, ecology, and evolution of life on Earth.\\nIn particular, mutualisms function through reciprocal exploitation that ultimately provides net benefits to each partner, with the resulting functionality of the unit constrained to the attributes of each partner.\\nReefbuilding corals depend on nutrients translocated from endosymbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellates in the family Symbiodiniaceae for survival © 2023 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.\\nAll rights reserved.\\nand growth.\\nNumerous different host–symbiont combinations exhibit a wide breadth of functional diversity important to the persistence and resiliency of the ecosystems they construct [1–3].\\nNotably, the sensitivity of reef-building corals to acute environmental stressors including prolonged and/or extreme periods of irradiance and/or temperature stress is influenced by the identity and physiology of their dinoflagellate partner [2,4–7].\\nCorals hosting symbionts that maintain physiological function under such conditions have reduced symbiont cell loss (coral bleaching), less mortality, and faster recoveries [1,8–11].\\nA body of evidence suggests that the costs of thermal tolerance manifest as reduced nutrient translocation [12–15] and significant negative physiological tradeoffs to the host coral such as reduced growth and fecundity [16–18], although some findings contradict this perception [19–23].\\nWhile partner specificity is largely intrinsic to most coral– dinoflagellate mutualisms, the fidelity between host and symbiont is partially influenced by prevailing environmental conditions, and why thermal history and light availability often explains the dominance of certain host-compatible symbionts over others [24,25].\\nPartner specificity is especially magnified in coral taxa where symbionts are transferred during egg maturation (vertical acquisition or transmission) [26,27].\\nContrary to horizontal transmission (symbiont acquired from the environment), vertical transmission reinforces the maintenance of certain host–symbiont combinations for generations, leading to ecological (host habitat) specialization by the symbiont [28].\\nYet, vertical transmission only occurs in several, albeit widespread and ecologically successful, host taxa including members of the genera Porites and Montipora, as well as corals in the family Pocilloporidae.\\nIn some cases, these co-evolved host–symbiont pairings may have greater functional integration compared to associations reliant on horizontal transmission [22].\\nThe first reports that related differential colony mortality to the identity of the resident symbiont originated in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) following the 1997–1998 El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event when water temperatures were 2–4°C warmer than historical average temperatures [1].\\nPocillopora grandis colonies that hosted Durusdinium glynnii remained pigmented during this thermal anomaly and experienced little to no mortality, while colonies that bleached contained Cladocopium latusorum as did colonies of P. verrucosa (presumably) with Cladocopium pacificum [1,29].\\nThis differential response to environmental stressors was later confirmed when 90% of P. grandis colonies containing C. latusorum and just 10% of colonies with D. glynnii visibly bleached during cold-water events in 2007 and 2008 [30,31].\\nThus, the greater stress tolerance of colonies with D. glynnii mostly explains the relative dominance of this host–symbiont combination across the Eastern Pacific tropical and sub-tropical coasts of North and Central America [1,9,32,33].\\nThe Eastern Pacific is an ideal study system to compare how different symbionts can affect the functionality of an ecologically dominant coral.\\nPocillopora grandis with either D. glynnii or C. latusorum, occur at similar depths and in many of the same habitats, with few colonies containing mixtures of each symbiont [9,34,35].\\nHere, the functional performance of both partnerships was studied under normal conditions and during a thermal stress experiment.\\nCritical attributes of these mutualisms, including symbiont cell densities and division rates, photophysiology, colony\\ngrowth, calcification, calyx dimensions and fecundity were examined to evaluate how different symbiont species affect the host animal’s well-being and reveal possible metabolic trade-offs associated with thermal tolerance.\\n2. Methods\\n(a) Colony sampling and transect configuration for symbiont species identification, ecological prevalence and within-host abundance\\nThree independent sampling methods were conducted to sample colonies of Pocillopora grandis, also referred to in the literature using the junior synonym P. eydouxi.\\nThis is the only genetically verified Pocillopora species found along Mexico’s Pacific coastline [36].\\nIn 2004, during an initial biodiversity survey, 129 colonies were sampled using a hammer and chisel from various habitats at depths of 1–8 m in the Gulf of California region around La Paz.\\nAt Punta Galeras Reef (24° 21.2567 N, 110° 17.0833 W) and La Gaviota Island (24° 17.2 N; 110° 20.3333 W) three 25 m long linear permanent transects were established at each location in May 2006 as described in LaJeunesse et al., [34] where 18–24 tagged colonies were sampled per transect (122 total).\\nLastly, three 20 m diameter circular/polar plot surveys (greater than 30 m apart) at Punta Galeras Reef and three at La Gaviota Island were conducted to randomly sample colonies in a circular area according to Baums et al.\\n[37] (118 colonies total) [37].\\nSymbiont species were identified by DGGE-ITS2/ITS1 profiling and sequencing as described in [27,34,38].\\nEach sample used was sequenced following each field season-sampling/experimental timepoint- providing a total of 595 of samples.\\nThe symbiont identity in colonies used for all experiments was confirmed using the same methods.\\n(b) Symbiont cell sizes, mitotic indices, and densities\\nTissue was removed from branch fragments representing each of seven colonies containing C. latusorum and nine colonies with where a, b, and c is equal to half the length,width and height (equal to width), respectively.\\nD. glynnii in July 2007 (colonies were from the established transects with known symbiont species).\\nOne ml of tissue slurry was preserved with 10uL of 10% glutaraldehyde.\\nSymbiont cell sizes were measured at 400× on an Olympus Bx61 compound microscope (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with the ORCA ER (Model C4742-80) andOlympusDP71 at the Penn StateMicroscopy Facility.\\nThe maximum length and width of at least 50 cells per colony were measured using ImageJ.\\nAverage ellipsoid cell volume was calculated using the formula,\\nV\\n¼\\n4\\n3 P abc\\nMaximum cell division time was estimated by collecting cells every three hours from 03.30 to 21.30 from polyps 1.5–2 cm below the branch tips of three different Pocillopora colonies (genets) containing D. glynnii and three colonies containing C. latusorum in July 2007.\\nSymbiont cells were isolated from host tissues with a pipette tip to remove and macerate 1–2 polyps.\\nThe slurry was placed in a 0.5 ml Eppendorf tube and fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde.\\nCell number and dividing cells (recorded as doublets and tetrads) were recorded with a haemocytometer (the cells in each of the three 10 µl sub-samples were counted).\\nThe mitotic index was calculated by dividing the number of dividing cells by the total cells present [39].\\nSymbiont densities were estimated by removing tissue from 8 coral fragments (four fragments each for C. latusorum and D. glynnii) with a WaterPik and filtered seawater (0.4 µm) in July 2007 [40].\\nThe tissue slurry volume was recorded, and symbiont cells were counted using a haemocytometer on a light microscope.\\nThe hot wax method [41] was used to measure coral surface area, as described in detail in [9].\\nTotal symbiont-to-host biomass ratios were calculated by multiplying the average symbiont cell volume by the average symbiont cell densities per host tissue area.\\n(c) Relative colony fecundity\\nDuring July 2008, nearing the first peak in Pocillopora grandis spawning in the Gulf of California [42], three fragments each from six tagged colonies with D. glynnii and seven colonies with C. latusorum were collected using a hammer and chisel and preserved in 10% seawater formalin.\\nFragments were then decalcified in 10% hydrochloric acid for 24 h and embedded in paraffin wax.\\nCoral tissue was sectioned (10 µm) with a microtome, and six slides were used per fragment with each containing three to five sections approximately 0.5 cm below the growing tip and three to five sections approximately 0.5 cm above the base of the fragment.\\nSlide images were recorded on an Olympus Bx61 microscope (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with the ORCA ER (Model C4742-80) and Olympus DP71 at the Penn State Microscopy Facility.\\nOocytes with a visible, stained nucleus (indicating the centre and the maximum diameter of the oocyte) were photographed, and the maximum Ferret diameter of each oocyte was measured using ImageJ.\\nSeparately, the number of oocytes and spermaries from three randomly selected, cross-sectional polyps per slide were counted and used as a proxy for relative fecundity.\\n(d) Host growth, calcification, linear extension and calyx dimensions\\nOne fragment per colony from 6 colonies containing C. latusorum and 5 colonies with D. glynnii were collected in May 2010 and maintained in outdoor seawater flow-through tables at 26°C under a shade cloth providing a maximal mid-day irradiance of approximately 400 µmol quanta m−2 s−1.\\nInstantaneous rates of calcification were measured following the procedure from Yao and Byrne 1998 [43] which is based on the alkalinity anomaly technique wherein each molar equivalent reduction in total alkalinity of seawater corresponds to one precipitated mole of CaCO3 [44,45].\\nEach fragment was incubated for one hour in 200 ml acrylic chambers containing 0.45 µm filtered seawater with a stir bar and held at a constant temperature of 25.5°C ± 0.5 with 400 µm quanta m−2s−1 from 6W pure white LED bulbs.\\nThe instantaneous calcification rate was calculated by spectrophotometrically measuring the change in total alkalinity of seawater of the incubation seawater using an Ocean Optics USB4000 spectrophotometer (Ocean Insight, Orlando Fl.).\\nIn June 2008, coral growth was recorded by buoyant weight [46] by collecting and initially weighing fragments from 33 colonies containing D. glynnii and 44 colonies containing C. latusorum.\\nFragments were mounted on 1.500 PVC couplers and were subsequently attached to the reef and then collected and reweighed four months later in October 2008 and one year later in June 2009.\\nDNA was extracted from each fragment and analysed to identify symbiont species after the last weight measurement.\\nCoral branch linear extension was determined in situ over the course of eight months from October 2008 to June 2009.\\nA plastic band was placed on four randomly selected branches approximately 50 cm near the centre of 10 colonies containing D. glynnii and 10 colonies containing C. latusorum, and the distance from the band to the branch tip was measured.\\nThe band-to-branch length was again measured in June 2009 for all\\nexcept 5 D. glynnii colonies, which were removed from the analysis as half of the banded branches were lost from the colony.\\nDNA was extracted and analysed to identify symbiont species at the end of the experiment.\\nFive calices were randomly selected for measurement from five previously collected, genotyped, and photographed colonies containing C. latusorum and 15 containing D. glynnii.\\nThe maximum and minimum diameters of each calyx cup and the distance to the nearest calyx were measured using ImageJ.\\n(e) Experimental thermal stress and photophysiology\\nAs described in detail in [31], tagged P. grandis colonies containing C. latusorum andD.\\nglynniiwere collected from 3–5 m and brought back into shaded seawater flow-through tanks at Universidad Autónoma de Baja California Sur in July 2007, which received a similar maximal mid-day irradiance as that recorded on the reef (approx. 950–1000 µmol photons m−2 s−1).\\nTwelve host fragments per symbiont species were mounted using marine epoxy onto 1.500 PVC couplers, divided and placed into control tanks, and maintained at 26°C for 36 h for a short acclimation period.\\nIn the experimental tanks, temperature was increasingly ramped 1.5°C per day until reaching 32°C and then held at 32°C for 7 more days, while control tanks remained at 26°C for the entirety of the experiment.\\nDuring acclimation and throughout the experiment, single-turnover active chlorophyll a fluorescence was monitored with a fluorescence induction and relaxation (FIRe) fluorometer fitted with a fibre optic probe (Satlantic).\\nAfter dark acclimating fragments for 20 min, a 120 µs saturation light pulse was applied.\\nFluorescence kinetics were averaged from ten fluorescence induction curves (n = 10) and were fit to a biophysical model [47] in order to calculate the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II, Fv/Fm, as (Fm− Fo)/Fm = Fv/Fm), as well as the PSII functional absorption cross-section (σPSII) which is a measure of photon capture efficiency and is indicative of the ability to absorb and use light, and the reoxidation rate of photosystem II (PSII) (τ), which indicates the speed atwhich electrons aremoving between primary and secondary quinones in PSII.\\nDecreased photosynthetic efficiency, slowed reoxidation rates, and larger σPSII are often observed with thermal/light stress [6,22,23,49,48].\\nAfter 24 h at either control (26°C) or treatment (32°C), symbiont cells were isolated and the mitotic index was quantified during maximum cell division.\\n(f) Data analysis\\nAll data were checked for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test and qqplots.\\nWhere the assumption of normality was not met, non-parametric tests were used to test deviations from null hypotheses.\\nDuring the high-temperature experiment, Fv/Fm, σPSII, τ, and mitotic indices were compared using the linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) using the lme4 package [50], with fixed effects including symbiont species, day, and treatment, and random effect of the fragment, to assess the influence of symbiont species and thermal exposure (28° or 32°C) andduration (1–7 days) on a colony’s photophysiology.\\nPairwise post hoc comparisons were performed using the ‘emmeans’ package [51].\\nCell densities were normalized to a regression-based standard curve of host tissue surface areas and total densities and cell sizes were compared using Student’s t-test.\\nBuoyant weights were tested with LMMs with fixed effects of symbiont species, time, and random effect of the fragment, with post hoc comparisons as previously described.\\nInstantaneous calcification rates were analysed using Student’s t-test.\\nThe non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to analyse branch linear extension, oocyte size, relative fecundity, as well as calyx diameters and distances to the nearest neighbour calyx.\\nMetric means and standard deviations are reported.\\nFor each test, outliers were removed and re-analysed, with deviations from the interpretations noted.\\n(b)(a) (c)\\n0180\\n270 20\\n10\\nFigure 1.\\nPocillopora grandis colonies in the Eastern Pacific predominately host

the number of colonies with the corresponding symbiont per site.\\nBrown indicates the proportion of colonies with C. latusorum while yellow indicates those with D. glynnii as the dominant symbiont.\\n3. Results\\n(a) High prevalence of colonies housing thermally tolerant D. glynnii and rare detection of symbiont mixtures.\\nUsing three different sampling approaches,D.\\nglynniiwasmost prevalent in a majority of P. grandis colonies (figure 1a–c).\\nDifferences in the prevalence of colonies with C. latusorum ranged from 6–34% which differed from location to location, mode of sampling, and year.\\nColonies with mixtures of each symbiont were typically rare (≤5%), but highest in areas where colonies with C. latusorum were most common (approx. 15% of colonies; figure 1b).\\nThe co-occurrence of both host–symbiont pairing allowed for the comparison of their phenotypic and physiological attributes (figure 2a).\\n(b) Total volumes of the symbiont populations were generally equivalent for each host–symbiont combination\\nThemean cell sizes (width and length) ofD.\\nglynniiwere smaller than C. latusorum (figure 2b).\\nThe mean cell volumes calculated for D. glynnii were therefore significantly smaller than C. latusorum (p < 0.001) (table 1).\\nMean D. glynnii cell densities were greater than the cell densities of C. latusorum (p= 0.006; figure 2c; table 1).\\nThe marked difference in cell volume when combined with cell density differences in the host, results in equivalent average symbiont volume per area of host tissue;\\n18.61 for colonies with D. glynnii and 18.41 with C. latusorum.\\n(c) Cell division rates differed diurnally and seasonally\\nOver a 24-h sampling cycle in July, cell division rates for both species were highest 1–3 h after sunrise (figure 2d).\\nThe same peak division time was confirmed in January (data not shown).\\nThis diurnal peak in cell division (mitotic index) was twice as high (6% versus 3%) for D. glynnii than C. latusorum in the summer (July) (figure 2d).\\nHowever, in the winter, the peak mitotic index increased significantly for C. latusorum while it was significantly decreased for D. glynnii to the extent that peak per cent cell division was higher for C. latusorum than D. glynnii (5% versus 3%; p < 0.001f; figure 3d; table 2).\\n(d) Oocyte size, not fecundity, differed among host–symbiont pairings\\nFecundity (figure 2e), estimated as the average number of gametes (oocytes and spermaries) per polyp, was similar between the superior (approx. 2 cm from tip) and inferior (6–8 cm from tip) positions of each coral branch examined regardless of the symbiont hosted (p > 0.31; table 1).\\nMoreover, fecundity was similar between each host–symbiont combination (p > 0.1; figure 2f; table 1).\\nOocyte size ranges followed a bimodal distribution in all colonies (figure 2g), corresponding to different early stages in oocyte development (i.e. I–III) as well as for mature oocytes (stage IV).\\nColonies with C. latusorum had larger oocytes than colonies with D. glynnii (p < 0.001; figure 2g; table 1).\\n(e) Biomass increase, calcification rates, linear extension as well as calyx cup sizes and distance of separation were equivalent between host–symbiont pairings\\nMean buoyant weights of small out-planted experimental colonies increased 40% after 6 months and 260% after one year (p < 0.001).\\nThere was no statistical difference in weight gain between colonies with D. glynnii or C. latusorum (p > 0.93; figure 2h; table 1).\\nLikewise, branches with either D. glynnii or C. latusorum calcified at the same rate (p = 0.12; figure 2i; table 1) and branch linear extension of large adult colonies in situ was similar after eight months (p = 0.17; figure 2j; table 1).\\nAverage calyx sizes between colonies with D. glynnii or C. latusorum were also similar (p = 0.053) as was the distance between nearest calices (p = 0.78; table 1; electronic supplementary material, figure S1).\\n(f) Colonies with D\\nf) Colonies with D. glynnii tolerated high temperatures, while colonies with C. latusorum underwent photoinactivation No photophysiological differences were observed in the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), functional absorption cross section (σPSII) or rate of reoxidation (τ) in control or heat treatment colonies hostingD.\\nglynnii (p > 0.2; figure 3a,b; table 2).\\nThese variables did not change in C. latusorum control colonies besides having slower reoxidation rates (τ) by day 6 of the experiment (p< 0.004; table 2).\\nHowever, Fv/Fm declined significantly in heat-treated C. latusorum colonies beginning on day 3 of the experiment (p= 0.01; table 2) and continued until day 7 (p 0.001; table 2).\\nThe σPSII increased by day 3\\n(b) (c) (d )\\n10\\n5\\n7 4 12 6 3\\n0 summer winter developing oocytes (stages I–III) mature oocytes (stage IV)\\n\\n |  | 0\\n | --- | ---\\n | 0 | 0 | 30 | 60 | 90\\n | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---\\n |  | 5\\n | 10 | 4 32 21\\n | 8\\n | 1\\n | 0 0 8 10 12 146 cell width (�m) 2 0.03 (e) (f) (g) 7.5 0.04\\n | * *\\n | 5.0\\n | 20 60\\n | 0.02\\n | 1 2.5 0.01\\n | 80 100\\n | oocyte diameter (�m)\\n\\n(a) (i) ( j) *\\n*\\n* (h)\\n*\\n*\\n* 1.25 40 30\\n600\\n1.00\\n400 20 0.75\\n10 200 0.50 0 0.25\\nD. glynnii C. latusorum\\n0 6 mo 1 yr Figure 2.\\nEmergent properties of co-evolved host–symbiont mutualisms.\\n(a) Analyses of two host–symbiont combinations conducted at different biological scales ranging from cellular dynamics of the dinoflagellate symbiont (top), fecundity at the polyp scale (middle), to colony-scale growth rates (bottom).\\nColonies of Pocillopora grandis dominated by Durusdinium glynnii appear yellow-orange, while colonies with Cladocopium latusorum appear brownish.\\n(b) Cell dimensions (length and width) of C. latusorum are larger than those of D. glynnii (large symbols represent mean dimensions of cells obtained from independent colonies), (c) Cell densities in host tissues were different for colonies with C. latusorum (brown) or D. glynnii (yellow-orange) (p = 0.006).\\n(d) Each symbiont exhibited diurnal oscillation in mitotic indices with peak division rates 1–3 h after sunrise (grey shading = night).\\nSummer-time cell division rates (proportion of dividing cells to the total number of cells) measured over a 24-hour period for C. latusorum and D. glynnii.\\nInset shows significant differences in peak mitotic indices in the summer (S) versus the winter season (W) for each symbiont species.\\n(e) Histological transverse cross-section of polyp showing mesenteries (M), oocytes (Ooc), oocyte nuclei (N), oocyte nucleolus (NU), and spermaries (SP).\\n(f) Average number of oocytes (left, p = 0.52) and spermaries (right, p = 0.1) per polyp for P. grandis with C. latusorum or D. glynnii, respectively.\\n(g) Bi-modal size distribution of developing (stages I–III) and mature (stage IV) oocytes.\\nOocytes in colonies with D. glynnii were smaller for each developmental stage (p < 0.001).\\n(h) Increases in buoyant weights at 6 months and one year (p > 0.93), (i) instantaneous calcification rates (p = 0.12), and (j) linear branch extension (p = 0.17) were similar between colonies with each symbiont species.\\nError bars represent one standard deviation.\\n(p = 0.02; table 2) and day 7 (p< 0.001; table 2) in heat-treated C. latusorum compared to controls, and the reoxidation rate slowed at day 7 (p = 0.002; figure 3; table 2).\\n(g) Cell division rates of D. glynnii increased at high experimental temperatures\\nIn experimentally heat-treated colonies, the mitotic indices of D. glynnii were significantly higher than the controls p 0.001; figure 3c; table 2), whereas peak mitotic indices C. latusorum were similar to the controls during heat treatment p 0.82; figure 3c; table 2).\\n4. Discussion\\n(a) The functional convergence of different host– symbiont combinations\\n(i) Mutualisms converged on a functionally stable and productive unit\\nThe similarities in growth as well as gamete production, seen here, indicate that colonies derive similar metabolic benefits from hosting evolutionarily divergent symbionts (figure 2).\\nThe steady-state condition, or phenotype, of P. grandis with each symbiont species is noticeably distinct.\\nYet the emergent effect of each combination produces functionally similar mutualisms under normal environmental conditions.\\nWhile colonies with C. latusorum have considerably fewer symbiont cells per surface area, this difference is compensated by the greater C. latusorum cell size relative to D. glynnii (figure 2b).\\nTherefore, the total standing biomass of each resident symbiont population is nearly equivalent and partially explains the similarities in attributes related to colony growth and reproduction.\\nWhile estimates of nutrient translocation were beyond the scope of this study, independent research recently determined that colonies with D. glynnii received considerable nutrient inputs from this symbiont [23].\\nTaken together, these findings emphasize high functionality in different mutualisms, especially in ones that are co-evolved [22,23].\\nTable 1.\\nSummary statistics

combination (figure 2h–j).\\nThis variability is typical for most corals and is probably influenced by genotypic differences, phenotypic plasticity, microenvironmental conditions and some combination of these factors [11,52].\\nHowever, these inter-colony variabilities were remarkably similar for each mutualism, showing no differences in any growth measurements (figure 2h–j, electronic supplementary material, figure S1).\\nThe only biological metric that indicated a physiological discrepancy between each mutualistic combination was the difference in mean egg sizes.\\nWhile relative fecundity did not differ between colonies with either symbiont (figure 2f), at the July sampling, colonies withD.\\nglynnii had slightly smaller oocytes than colonies harbouring C. latusorum (figure 2g).\\nThis observation is similar to previous findings where egg size and number appeared uncorrelated [17,52].\\nBecause this incongruity may be explained by differences in the timing of oocyte maturation, additional temporal sampling is needed to assess whether this difference remained constant throughout oocyte maturation and spawning.\\nUltimately, tracking fertilization success, larval survivorship and settlement rate is required to determine whether egg number and size represent accurate proxies for colony health and reproductive fitness.\\nIn some studies, coral oocyte sizes correlated positively with energy reserves, such as lipids [53], and was assumed to be indicative animal’s energetic health [17], but other studies found that larger, more developed, oocytes do not always correlate with higher lipid concentrations [54].\\nDifferences in oocyte sizemayaffect dispersal success to near and/or distant habitats [55].\\nThus, size variation could be advantageous in some situations and increase the probability of survival in unpredictable environments [56].\\n(a)\\n | heat experiment |  | \\n | --- | --- | ---\\n | 26ºC 32ºC |  | \\n | ramp treatment 32º\\n |

combination.\\n(a) Experimental design for a thermal stress experiment.\\nReplicate fragments from each of 6 colonies with Durusdinium glynnii and 6 colonies with C. latusorum were divided into treatment tanks incrementally ramped to 32°C, and control tanks which remained at 26°C.\\nColonies were then monitored for 7 days.\\n(b) Colonies with D. glynnii exposed to 32°C exhibited no differences in photochemistry relative to controls (p > 0.2).\\nBy day 7, Fv/Fm decreased (p < 0.001), the functional absorption cross-section (σ) increased (p < 0.001), and the rate of reoxidation of the primary quinone acceptor –QA of PSII (τ) was slower (p = 0.002) for colonies with Cladocopium latusorum relative to controls.\\nDarker colours represent controls and lighter exposed to 32°C.\\n(c) After 7 days at 32°C, peak mitotic indices for D. glynnii were significantly higher than for cells at control temperatures (p = 0.038), while the mean mitotic index for C. latusorum lowered significantly relative to controls (p = 0.004).\\nAll error bars and shaded regions represent one standard deviation.\\n(d) Field images showing differential bleaching among P. grandis colonies with C. latusorum (bleached) versus those with D. glynnii (pigmented) after cold water anomaly in 2007 and 2008.\\n(ii) Differences in seasonal acclimatization\\nWater temperatures and day length oscillate substantially between summer and winter in the Gulf of California [57].\\nChanges in these physical conditions appear to differentially affect cell division rates of C. latusorum and D. glynnii.\\nWith each species having different thermal and light optima for growth, seasonal differences in resource availability likely influence cell proliferation [58,59].\\nAdditionally, differences between symbiont species in cell size and in hospite densities likely regulate their acquisition of inorganic nutrients, which may alter their physiological condition [60].\\nHowever, while seasonal cell division differed between these symbionts, Pettay et al.\\n[61] and McGinley et al.\\n[31,62] found their intra-colony dominance remained stable in tagged colonies during and after thermal stress events [61,62].\\nMost colonies are overwhelmingly dominated by one symbiont, with the other species often detected at trace levels (less than 1% of total symbiont cells in a colony; figure 1) [62].\\nNot only does one symbiont species persist [30,34,62], this stability often extends to the symbiont’s genotype or clonal cell line.\\nWhile rapid shifts in symbiont dominance sometimes occur in a subset of Pocillopora colonies (less than 5%), shifts were random, not favouring a particular symbiont over the other, and noted only after a stressful cold-water episode [62].\\nTable 2.\\nComparisons of seasonal mitotic indices (MI), per cent change in buoyant weights after six months and one year, as well as measures during the thermal experiment of MI, Fv/Fm, σPSII

personal observation).\\nThe adaptive radiation of Durusdinium in the Indo-West Pacific during the Pleistocene led to the evolution of numerous ecologically specialized species like D. glynnii that maintain stable associations with specific host taxa [11,25,65].\\nMoreover, facilitated by vertical transmission, pocilloporid corals share a close evolutionary history with their symbionts, which further explains their high-functioning mutualism with D. glynnii [26,71].\\nThese evolutionary factors reconcile the present findings with previous reports of significant growth trade-offs among corals with thermally tolerant symbionts [15–17].\\nPrevious reports of growth tradeoffs are context dependent and possibly explained by different factors, including the geographical location and species identity of the Durusdinium under study.\\nJuvenile Acropora colonies experienced almost 50% reduced growth (measured as the number of new polyps added over time) when associated with Durusdinium sp.\\non the Great Barrier Reef [16].\\nMoreover, adult colonies had 25–30% fewer lipid stores and smaller oocytes than colonies harbouring Cladocopium spp.\\n[17].\\nLower rates of translocated photosynthate accounts for the reduced growth, lowenergy reserves and smaller oocyte sizesmeasured in these GBR Acropora colonies [15].\\nThe Acropora-Durusdinium combinations found on the GBR are rare, however, and occur in the most marginal of reef habitats [15–17,72,73], indicating that the environments of this reef system do not readily support mutualisms involving this genus of symbiont.\\nSimilarly, Caribbean Orbicella colonies hosting Durusdinium trenchii exhibit approximately 50% lower calcification rates ([18], but see also [74]), have lower tissue biomass, and fewer nutrient reserves (D. W. Kemp 2023, personal communication).\\nHowever, D. trenchii is a non-native species recently introduced from the Indo-Pacific [18].\\nUltimately, earlier characterizations of poor growth seem to relate to rare or introduced species of Durusdinium, representing maladapted mutualisms lacking a coevolutionary history.\\nArguably, physiological performance is expected to be optimized in host corals like Pocilloporawhich have coevolved for hundreds of thousands to millions of years with symbionts in the genus Durusdinium [25].\\nAs research expands to more tropical warm-water regions of the Indo-Pacific, these host–symbiont pairings do not appear to experience reduced translocation or calcification (D. W. Kemp et al. 2023, unpublished data).\\nD. glynnii in Pocillopora supports high rates of photosynthesis per cell and maintains carbon translocation under higher temperature [23].\\nIndeed, a clearer understanding of the natural history of reef corals and their symbionts, including the discernment of closely related symbiont species, is necessary to better explain physiological and ecological patterns and processes.\\n(d) Host dependency on co-evolved symbionts in a changing climate\\nThese findings provide insight into the persistence of reef corals as oceans continue to warm and marine heat waves increase in frequency [75,76].\\nBecause certain symbiont species raise the thermal tolerance of host corals by 1–2°C, different host–symbiont partner combinations induce phenotypic change faster than evolutionary adaptation.\\nThis ecological response is limited by partner specificity and symbiont availability [6,77–79], however, many stress-tolerant symbionts, including D. glynnii, are widespread throughout the IndoPacific [65,66].\\nIn some mutualisms, harbouring symbionts with physiological adaptations that allow tollerance to high temperatures can result in metabolic tradeoffs affecting colony growth and fitness.\\nBy contrast, the physiological inte- gration between co-evolved mutualisms, like Pocillopora and D. glynnii, creates fast-growing, highly fecund, colonies with few observable trade-offs.\\nThe larger implications of these findings are numerous.\\nIncreased prevalence of these mutualisms under higher or more variable ocean temperatures may continue to support ecosystem productivity and contribute to reef growth [33].\\nFuture comprehensive analyses, such as the present case study, will offer better insights into the functional ecology of coral–dinoflagellate mutualisms and how partner diversity in these relationships creates important variation critical in their responses to climate change.\\nData accessibility.\\nAll data are provided in the online electronic supplementary material, which is deposited in Dryad: https://doi.\\norg/10.5061/dryad.b8gtht7j0 [80].\\nAll R code used in analyses are available via github at the following link: https://github.com/KiraTurnham/Pocillopora-thermal-tolerance.\\nAdditional information is provided in electronic supplementary material [81].\\nAuthors’ contributions.\\nK.E.T.\\n: data curation, formal analysis, investigation, methodology, project administration, resources, software, validation, visualization, writing—original draft, writing—review and editing; M.D.A.\\n: data curation, investigation, methodology, validation, writing—review and editing; D.T.P.\\n: data curation, investigation, methodology, validation, writing—review and editing; D.A.P.-G.\\n: investigation, methodology, validation, writing—review and editing; H.R.-B.\\n: investigation, methodology, resources; J.P.\\n: data curation, funding acquisition, investigation, methodology, validation, writing—review and editing; E.T.\\n: data curation, validation; R.T.S.\\n: data curation, investigation, methodology, validation, writing—review and editing; M.P.M.\\n: data curation, investigation, methodology, validation, writing—review and editing; M.E.W.\\n: conceptualization, data curation, funding acquisition, investigation, methodology, project administration, resources, supervision, validation, writing—review and editing; T.C.L.\\n: conceptualization, data curation, funding acquisition, investigation, methodology, project administration, resources, software, supervision, validation, visualization, writing—original draft, writing—review and editing.\\nAll authors gave final approval for publication and agreed to be held accountable for the work performed therein.\\nConflict of interest declaration.\\nWe declare we have no competing interests.\\nFunding.\\nThis research was funded by the National Science Foundation (grant no.

Introduction\\nElectronic supplementary material is available online at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.\\nSymbioses profoundly influence the diversity, ecology, and evolution of life on Earth.\\nIn particular, mutualisms function through reciprocal exploitation that ultimately provides net benefits to each partner, with the resulting functionality of the unit constrained to the attributes of each partner.\\nReefbuilding corals depend on nutrients translocated from endosymbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellates in the family Symbiodiniaceae for survival © 2023 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.\\nAll rights reserved.\\nand growth.\\nNumerous different host–symbiont combinations exhibit a wide breadth of functional diversity important to the persistence and resiliency of the ecosystems they construct [1–3].\\nNotably, the sensitivity of reef-building corals to acute environmental stressors including prolonged and/or extreme periods of irradiance and/or temperature stress is influenced by the identity and physiology of their dinoflagellate partner [2,4–7].\\nCorals hosting symbionts that maintain physiological function under such conditions have reduced symbiont cell loss (coral bleaching), less mortality, and faster recoveries [1,8–11].\\nA body of evidence suggests that the costs of thermal tolerance manifest as reduced nutrient translocation [12–15] and significant negative physiological tradeoffs to the host coral such as reduced growth and fecundity [16–18], although some findings contradict this perception [19–23].\\nWhile partner specificity is largely intrinsic to most coral– dinoflagellate mutualisms, the fidelity between host and symbiont is partially influenced by prevailing environmental conditions, and why thermal history and light availability often explains the dominance of certain host-compatible symbionts over others [24,25].\\nPartner specificity is especially magnified in coral taxa where symbionts are transferred during egg maturation (vertical acquisition or transmission) [26,27].\\nContrary to horizontal transmission (symbiont acquired from the environment), vertical transmission reinforces the maintenance of certain host–symbiont combinations for generations, leading to ecological (host habitat) specialization by the symbiont [28].\\nYet, vertical transmission only occurs in several, albeit widespread and ecologically successful, host taxa including members of the genera Porites and Montipora, as well as corals in the family Pocilloporidae.\\nIn some cases, these co-evolved host–symbiont pairings may have greater functional integration compared to associations reliant on horizontal transmission [22].\\nThe first reports that related differential colony mortality to the identity of the resident symbiont originated in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) following the 1997–1998 El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event when water temperatures were 2–4°C warmer than historical average temperatures [1].\\nPocillopora grandis colonies that hosted Durusdinium glynnii remained pigmented during this thermal anomaly and experienced little to no mortality, while colonies that bleached contained Cladocopium latusorum as did colonies of P. verrucosa (presumably) with Cladocopium pacificum [1,29].\\nThis differential response to environmental stressors was later confirmed when 90% of P. grandis colonies containing C. latusorum and just 10% of colonies with D. glynnii visibly bleached during cold-water events in 2007 and 2008 [30,31].\\nThus, the greater stress tolerance of colonies with D. glynnii mostly explains the relative dominance of this host–symbiont combination across the Eastern Pacific tropical and sub-tropical coasts of North and Central America [1,9,32,33].\\nThe Eastern Pacific is an ideal study system to compare how different symbionts can affect the functionality of an ecologically dominant coral.\\nPocillopora grandis with either D. glynnii or C. latusorum, occur at similar depths and in many of the same habitats, with few colonies containing mixtures of each symbiont [9,34,35].\\nHere, the functional performance of both partnerships was studied under normal conditions and during a thermal stress experiment.\\nCritical attributes of these mutualisms, including symbiont cell densities and division rates, photophysiology, colony\\ngrowth, calcification, calyx dimensions and fecundity were examined to evaluate how different symbiont species affect the host animal’s well-being and reveal possible metabolic trade-offs associated with thermal tolerance.\\n2. Methods\\n(a) Colony sampling and transect configuration for symbiont species identification, ecological prevalence and within-host abundance\\nThree independent sampling methods were conducted to sample colonies of Pocillopora grandis, also referred to in the literature using the junior synonym P. eydouxi.\\nThis is the only genetically verified Pocillopora species found along Mexico’s Pacific coastline [36].\\nIn 2004, during an initial biodiversity survey, 129 colonies were sampled using a hammer and chisel from various habitats at depths of 1–8 m in the Gulf of California region around La Paz.\\nAt Punta Galeras Reef (24° 21.2567 N, 110° 17.0833 W) and La Gaviota Island (24° 17.2 N; 110° 20.3333 W) three 25 m long linear permanent transects were established at each location in May 2006 as described in LaJeunesse et al., [34] where 18–24 tagged colonies were sampled per transect (122 total).\\nLastly, three 20 m diameter circular/polar plot surveys (greater than 30 m apart) at Punta Galeras Reef and three at La Gaviota Island were conducted to randomly sample colonies in a circular area according to Baums et al.\\n[37] (118 colonies total) [37].\\nSymbiont species were identified by DGGE-ITS2/ITS1 profiling and sequencing as described in [27,34,38].\\nEach sample used was sequenced following each field season-sampling/experimental timepoint- providing a total of 595 of samples.\\nThe symbiont identity in colonies used for all experiments was confirmed using the same methods.\\n(b) Symbiont cell sizes, mitotic indices, and densities\\nTissue was removed from branch fragments representing each of seven colonies containing C. latusorum and nine colonies with where a, b, and c is equal to half the length,width and height (equal to width), respectively.\\nD. glynnii in July 2007 (colonies were from the established transects with known symbiont species).\\nOne ml of tissue slurry was preserved with 10uL of 10% glutaraldehyde.\\nSymbiont cell sizes were measured at 400× on an Olympus Bx61 compound microscope (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with the ORCA ER (Model C4742-80) andOlympusDP71 at the Penn StateMicroscopy Facility.\\nThe maximum length and width of at least 50 cells per colony were measured using ImageJ.\\nAverage ellipsoid cell volume was calculated using the formula,\\nV\\n¼\\n4\\n3 P abc\\nMaximum cell division time was estimated by collecting cells every three hours from 03.30 to 21.30 from polyps 1.5–2 cm below the branch tips of three different Pocillopora colonies (genets) containing D. glynnii and three colonies containing C. latusorum in July 2007.\\nSymbiont cells were isolated from host tissues with a pipette tip to remove and macerate 1–2 polyps.\\nThe slurry was placed in a 0.5 ml Eppendorf tube and fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde.\\nCell number and dividing cells (recorded as doublets and tetrads) were recorded with a haemocytometer (the cells in each of the three 10 µl sub-samples were counted).\\nThe mitotic index was calculated by dividing the number of dividing cells by the total cells present [39].\\nSymbiont densities were estimated by removing tissue from 8 coral fragments (four fragments each for C. latusorum and D. glynnii) with a WaterPik and filtered seawater (0.4 µm) in July 2007 [40].\\nThe tissue slurry volume was recorded, and symbiont cells were counted using a haemocytometer on a light microscope.\\nThe hot wax method [41] was used to measure coral surface area, as described in detail in [9].\\nTotal symbiont-to-host biomass ratios were calculated by multiplying the average symbiont cell volume by the average symbiont cell densities per host tissue area.\\n(c) Relative colony fecundity\\nDuring July 2008, nearing the first peak in Pocillopora grandis spawning in the Gulf of California [42], three fragments each from six tagged colonies with D. glynnii and seven colonies with C. latusorum were collected using a hammer and chisel and preserved in 10% seawater formalin.\\nFragments were then decalcified in 10% hydrochloric acid for 24 h and embedded in paraffin wax.\\nCoral tissue was sectioned (10 µm) with a microtome, and six slides were used per fragment with each containing three to five sections approximately 0.5 cm below the growing tip and three to five sections approximately 0.5 cm above the base of the fragment.\\nSlide images were recorded on an Olympus Bx61 microscope (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with the ORCA ER (Model C4742-80) and Olympus DP71 at the Penn State Microscopy Facility.\\nOocytes with a visible, stained nucleus (indicating the centre and the maximum diameter of the oocyte) were photographed, and the maximum Ferret diameter of each oocyte was measured using ImageJ.\\nSeparately, the number of oocytes and spermaries from three randomly selected, cross-sectional polyps per slide were counted and used as a proxy for relative fecundity.\\n(d) Host growth, calcification, linear extension and calyx dimensions\\nOne fragment per colony from 6 colonies containing C. latusorum and 5 colonies with D. glynnii were collected in May 2010 and maintained in outdoor seawater flow-through tables at 26°C under a shade cloth providing a maximal mid-day irradiance of approximately 400 µmol quanta m−2 s−1.\\nInstantaneous rates of calcification were measured following the procedure from Yao and Byrne 1998 [43] which is based on the alkalinity anomaly technique wherein each molar equivalent reduction in total alkalinity of seawater corresponds to one precipitated mole of CaCO3 [44,45].\\nEach fragment was incubated for one hour in 200 ml acrylic chambers containing 0.45 µm filtered seawater with a stir bar and held at a constant temperature of 25.5°C ± 0.5 with 400 µm quanta m−2s−1 from 6W pure white LED bulbs.\\nThe instantaneous calcification rate was calculated by spectrophotometrically measuring the change in total alkalinity of seawater of the incubation seawater using an Ocean Optics USB4000 spectrophotometer (Ocean Insight, Orlando Fl.).\\nIn June 2008, coral growth was recorded by buoyant weight [46] by collecting and initially weighing fragments from 33 colonies containing D. glynnii and 44 colonies containing C. latusorum.\\nFragments were mounted on 1.500 PVC couplers and were subsequently attached to the reef and then collected and reweighed four months later in October 2008 and one year later in June 2009.\\nDNA was extracted from each fragment and analysed to identify symbiont species after the last weight measurement.\\nCoral branch linear extension was determined in situ over the course of eight months from October 2008 to June 2009.\\nA plastic band was placed on four randomly selected branches approximately 50 cm near the centre of 10 colonies containing D. glynnii and 10 colonies containing C. latusorum, and the distance from the band to the branch tip was measured.\\nThe band-to-branch length was again measured in June 2009 for all\\nexcept 5 D. glynnii colonies, which were removed from the analysis as half of the banded branches were lost from the colony.\\nDNA was extracted and analysed to identify symbiont species at the end of the experiment.\\nFive calices were randomly selected for measurement from five previously collected, genotyped, and photographed colonies containing C. latusorum and 15 containing D. glynnii.\\nThe maximum and minimum diameters of each calyx cup and the distance to the nearest calyx were measured using ImageJ.\\n(e) Experimental thermal stress and photophysiology\\nAs described in detail in [31], tagged P. grandis colonies containing C. latusorum andD.\\nglynniiwere collected from 3–5 m and brought back into shaded seawater flow-through tanks at Universidad Autónoma de Baja California Sur in July 2007, which received a similar maximal mid-day irradiance as that recorded on the reef (approx. 950–1000 µmol photons m−2 s−1).\\nTwelve host fragments per symbiont species were mounted using marine epoxy onto 1.500 PVC couplers, divided and placed into control tanks, and maintained at 26°C for 36 h for a short acclimation period.\\nIn the experimental tanks, temperature was increasingly ramped 1.5°C per day until reaching 32°C and then held at 32°C for 7 more days, while control tanks remained at 26°C for the entirety of the experiment.\\nDuring acclimation and throughout the experiment, single-turnover active chlorophyll a fluorescence was monitored with a fluorescence induction and relaxation (FIRe) fluorometer fitted with a fibre optic probe (Satlantic).\\nAfter dark acclimating fragments for 20 min, a 120 µs saturation light pulse was applied.\\nFluorescence kinetics were averaged from ten fluorescence induction curves (n = 10) and were fit to a biophysical model [47] in order to calculate the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II, Fv/Fm, as (Fm− Fo)/Fm = Fv/Fm), as well as the PSII functional absorption cross-section (σPSII) which is a measure of photon capture efficiency and is indicative of the ability to absorb and use light, and the reoxidation rate of photosystem II (PSII) (τ), which indicates the speed atwhich electrons aremoving between primary and secondary quinones in PSII.\\nDecreased photosynthetic efficiency, slowed reoxidation rates, and larger σPSII are often observed with thermal/light stress [6,22,23,49,48].\\nAfter 24 h at either control (26°C) or treatment (32°C), symbiont cells were isolated and the mitotic index was quantified during maximum cell division.\\n(f) Data analysis\\nAll data were checked for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test and qqplots.\\nWhere the assumption of normality was not met, non-parametric tests were used to test deviations from null hypotheses.\\nDuring the high-temperature experiment, Fv/Fm, σPSII, τ, and mitotic indices were compared using the linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) using the lme4 package [50], with fixed effects including symbiont species, day, and treatment, and random effect of the fragment, to assess the influence of symbiont species and thermal exposure (28° or 32°C) andduration (1–7 days) on a colony’s photophysiology.\\nPairwise post hoc comparisons were performed using the ‘emmeans’ package [51].\\nCell densities were normalized to a regression-based standard curve of host tissue surface areas and total densities and cell sizes were compared using Student’s t-test.\\nBuoyant weights were tested with LMMs with fixed effects of symbiont species, time, and random effect of the fragment, with post hoc comparisons as previously described.\\nInstantaneous calcification rates were analysed using Student’s t-test.\\nThe non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to analyse branch linear extension, oocyte size, relative fecundity, as well as calyx diameters and distances to the nearest neighbour calyx.\\nMetric means and standard deviations are reported.\\nFor each test, outliers were removed and re-analysed, with deviations from the interpretations noted.\\n(b)(a) (c)\\n0180\\n270 20\\n10\\nFigure 1.\\nPocillopora grandis colonies in the Eastern Pacific predominately host

2006 (>18 colonies per transect, n = 122 colonies from a total of six transects, three at each location).\\n(c) Randomized sampling of colonies from 20 m diameter circular plots in 2009 (n = 118).\\nEach point represents the number of colonies with the corresponding symbiont per site.\\nBrown indicates the proportion of colonies with C. latusorum while yellow indicates those with D. glynnii as the dominant symbiont.\\n3. Results\\n(a) High prevalence of colonies housing thermally tolerant D. glynnii and rare detection of symbiont mixtures.\\nUsing three different sampling approaches,D.\\nglynniiwasmost prevalent in a majority of P. grandis colonies (figure 1a–c).\\nDifferences in the prevalence of colonies with C. latusorum ranged from 6–34% which differed from location to location, mode of sampling, and year.\\nColonies with mixtures of each symbiont were typically rare (≤5%), but highest in areas where colonies with C. latusorum were most common (approx. 15% of colonies; figure 1b).\\nThe co-occurrence of both host–symbiont pairing allowed for the comparison of their phenotypic and physiological attributes (figure 2a).\\n(b) Total volumes of the symbiont populations were generally equivalent for each host–symbiont combination\\nThemean cell sizes (width and length) ofD.\\nglynniiwere smaller than C. latusorum (figure 2b).\\nThe mean cell volumes calculated for D. glynnii were therefore significantly smaller than C. latusorum (p < 0.001) (table 1).\\nMean D. glynnii cell densities were greater than the cell densities of C. latusorum (p= 0.006; figure 2c; table 1).\\nThe marked difference in cell volume when combined with cell density differences in the host, results in equivalent average symbiont volume per area of host tissue;\\n18.61 for colonies with D. glynnii and 18.41 with C. latusorum.\\n(c) Cell division rates differed diurnally and seasonally\\nOver a 24-h sampling cycle in July, cell division rates for both species were highest 1–3 h after sunrise (figure 2d).\\nThe same peak division time was confirmed in January (data not shown).\\nThis diurnal peak in cell division (mitotic index) was twice as high (6% versus 3%) for D. glynnii than C. latusorum in the summer (July) (figure 2d).\\nHowever, in the winter, the peak mitotic index increased significantly for C. latusorum while it was significantly decreased for D. glynnii to the extent that peak per cent cell division was higher for C. latusorum than D. glynnii (5% versus 3%; p < 0.001f; figure 3d; table 2).\\n(d) Oocyte size, not fecundity, differed among host–symbiont pairings\\nFecundity (figure 2e), estimated as the average number of gametes (oocytes and spermaries) per polyp, was similar between the superior (approx. 2 cm from tip) and inferior (6–8 cm from tip) positions of each coral branch examined regardless of the symbiont hosted (p > 0.31; table 1).\\nMoreover, fecundity was similar between each host–symbiont combination (p > 0.1; figure 2f; table 1).\\nOocyte size ranges followed a bimodal distribution in all colonies (figure 2g), corresponding to different early stages in oocyte development (i.e. I–III) as well as for mature oocytes (stage IV).\\nColonies with C. latusorum had larger oocytes than colonies with D. glynnii (p < 0.001; figure 2g; table 1).\\n(e) Biomass increase, calcification rates, linear extension as well as calyx cup sizes and distance of separation were equivalent between host–symbiont pairings\\nMean buoyant weights of small out-planted experimental colonies increased 40% after 6 months and 260% after one year (p < 0.001).\\nThere was no statistical difference in weight gain between colonies with D. glynnii or C. latusorum (p > 0.93; figure 2h; table 1).\\nLikewise, branches with either D. glynnii or C. latusorum calcified at the same rate (p = 0.12; figure 2i; table 1) and branch linear extension of large adult colonies in situ was similar after eight months (p = 0.17; figure 2j; table 1).\\nAverage calyx sizes between colonies with D. glynnii or C. latusorum were also similar (p = 0.053) as was the distance between nearest calices (p = 0.78; table 1; electronic supplementary material, figure S1).\\n(f) Colonies with D\\nf) Colonies with D. glynnii tolerated high temperatures, while colonies with C. latusorum underwent photoinactivation No photophysiological differences were observed in the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), functional absorption cross section (σPSII) or rate of reoxidation (τ) in control or heat treatment colonies hostingD.\\nglynnii (p > 0.2; figure 3a,b; table 2).\\nThese variables did not change in C. latusorum control colonies besides having slower reoxidation rates (τ) by day 6 of the experiment (p< 0.004; table 2).\\nHowever, Fv/Fm declined significantly in heat-treated C. latusorum colonies beginning on day 3 of the experiment (p= 0.01;

Discussion\\n(a) The functional convergence of different host– symbiont combinations\\n(i) Mutualisms converged on a functionally stable and productive unit\\nThe similarities in growth as well as gamete production, seen here, indicate that colonies derive similar metabolic benefits from hosting evolutionarily divergent symbionts (figure 2).\\nThe steady-state condition, or phenotype, of P. grandis with each symbiont species is noticeably distinct.\\nYet the emergent effect of each combination produces functionally similar mutualisms under normal environmental conditions.\\nWhile colonies with C. latusorum have considerably fewer symbiont cells per surface area, this difference is compensated by the greater C. latusorum cell size relative to D. glynnii (figure 2b).\\nTherefore, the total standing biomass of each resident symbiont population is nearly equivalent and partially explains the similarities in attributes related to colony growth and reproduction.\\nWhile estimates of nutrient translocation were beyond the scope of this study, independent research recently determined that colonies with D. glynnii received considerable nutrient inputs from this symbiont [23].\\nTaken together, these findings emphasize high functionality in different mutualisms, especially in ones that are co-evolved [22,23].\\nTable 1.\\nSummary statistics

combination (figure 2h–j).\\nThis variability is typical for most corals and is probably influenced by genotypic differences, phenotypic plasticity, microenvironmental conditions and some combination of these factors [11,52].\\nHowever, these inter-colony variabilities were remarkably similar for each mutualism, showing no differences in any growth measurements (figure 2h–j, electronic supplementary material, figure S1).\\nThe only biological metric that indicated a physiological discrepancy between each mutualistic combination was the difference in mean egg sizes.\\nWhile relative fecundity did not differ between colonies with either symbiont (figure 2f), at the July sampling, colonies withD.\\nglynnii had slightly smaller oocytes than colonies harbouring C. latusorum (figure 2g).\\nThis observation is similar to previous findings where egg size and number appeared uncorrelated [17,52].\\nBecause this incongruity may be explained by differences in the timing of oocyte maturation, additional temporal sampling is needed to assess whether this difference remained constant throughout oocyte maturation and spawning.\\nUltimately, tracking fertilization success, larval survivorship and settlement rate is required to determine whether egg number and size represent accurate proxies for colony health and reproductive fitness.\\nIn some studies, coral oocyte sizes correlated positively with energy reserves, such as lipids [53], and was assumed to be indicative animal’s energetic health [17], but other studies found that larger, more developed, oocytes do not always correlate with higher lipid concentrations [54].\\nDifferences in oocyte sizemayaffect dispersal success to near and/or distant habitats [55].\\nThus, size variation could be advantageous in some situations and increase the probability of survival in unpredictable environments [56].\\n(a)\\n | heat experiment |  | \\n | --- | --- | ---\\n | 26ºC 32ºC |  | \\n | ramp treatment 32º\\n |

C. latusorum (bleached) versus those with D. glynnii (pigmented) after cold water anomaly in 2007 and 2008.\\n(ii) Differences in seasonal acclimatization\\nWater temperatures and day length oscillate substantially between summer and winter in the Gulf of California [57].\\nChanges in these physical conditions appear to differentially affect cell division rates of C. latusorum and D. glynnii.\\nWith each species having different thermal and light optima for growth, seasonal differences in resource availability likely influence cell proliferation [58,59].\\nAdditionally, differences between symbiont species in cell size and in hospite densities likely regulate their acquisition of inorganic nutrients, which may alter their physiological condition [60].\\nHowever, while seasonal cell division differed between these symbionts, Pettay et al.\\n[61] and McGinley et al.\\n[31,62] found their intra-colony dominance remained stable in tagged colonies during and after thermal stress events [61,62].\\nMost colonies are overwhelmingly dominated by one symbiont, with the other species often detected at trace levels (less than 1% of total symbiont cells in a colony; figure 1) [62].\\nNot only does one symbiont species persist [30,34,62], this stability often extends to the symbiont’s genotype or clonal cell line.\\nWhile rapid shifts in symbiont dominance sometimes occur in a subset of Pocillopora colonies (less than 5%), shifts were random, not favouring a particular symbiont over the other, and noted only after a stressful cold-water episode [62].\\nTable 2.\\nComparisons of seasonal mitotic indices (MI), per cent change in buoyant weights after six months and one year, as well as measures during the thermal experiment of MI, Fv/Fm, σPSII

functionally stable and productive unit\\nThe similarities in growth as well as gamete production, seen here, indicate that colonies derive similar metabolic benefits from hosting evolutionarily divergent symbionts (figure 2).\\nThe steady-state condition, or phenotype, of P. grandis with each symbiont species is noticeably distinct.\\nYet the emergent effect of each combination produces functionally similar mutualisms under normal environmental conditions.\\nWhile colonies with C. latusorum have considerably fewer symbiont cells per surface area, this difference is compensated by the greater C. latusorum cell size relative to D. glynnii (figure 2b).\\nTherefore, the total standing biomass of each resident symbiont population is nearly equivalent and partially explains the similarities in attributes related to colony growth and reproduction.\\nWhile estimates of nutrient translocation were beyond the scope of this study, independent research recently determined that colonies with D. glynnii received considerable nutrient inputs from this symbiont [23].\\nTaken together, these findings emphasize high functionality in different mutualisms, especially in ones that are co-evolved [22,23].\\nTable 1.\\nSummary statistics for symbiont cell size, volume, mitotic index (MI) and density as well as host relative fecundity and growth measurements between Cladocopium

calcification and branch growth (linear extension) for each host–symbiont combination (figure 2h–j).\\nThis variability is typical for most corals and is probably influenced by genotypic differences, phenotypic plasticity, microenvironmental conditions and some combination of these factors [11,52].\\nHowever, these inter-colony variabilities were remarkably similar for each mutualism, showing no differences in any growth measurements (figure 2h–j, electronic supplementary material, figure S1).\\nThe only biological metric that indicated a physiological discrepancy between each mutualistic combination was the difference in mean egg sizes.\\nWhile relative fecundity did not differ between colonies with either symbiont (figure 2f), at the July sampling, colonies withD.\\nglynnii had slightly smaller oocytes than colonies harbouring C. latusorum (figure 2g).\\nThis observation is similar to previous findings where egg size and number appeared uncorrelated [17,52].\\nBecause this incongruity may be explained by differences in the timing of oocyte maturation, additional temporal sampling is needed to assess whether this difference remained constant throughout oocyte maturation and spawning.\\nUltimately, tracking fertilization success, larval survivorship and settlement rate is required to determine whether egg number and size represent accurate proxies for colony health and reproductive fitness.\\nIn some studies, coral oocyte sizes correlated positively with energy reserves, such as lipids [53], and was assumed to be indicative animal’s energetic health [17], but other studies found that larger, more developed, oocytes do not always correlate with higher lipid concentrations [54].\\nDifferences in oocyte sizemayaffect dispersal success to near and/or distant habitats [55].\\nThus, size variation could be advantageous in some situations and increase the probability of survival in unpredictable environments [56].\\n(a)\\n | heat experiment |  | \\n | --- |

substantially between summer and winter in the Gulf of California [57].\\nChanges in these physical conditions appear to differentially affect cell division rates of C. latusorum and D. glynnii.\\nWith each species having different thermal and light optima for growth, seasonal differences in resource availability likely influence cell proliferation [58,59].\\nAdditionally, differences between symbiont species in cell size and in hospite densities likely regulate their acquisition of inorganic nutrients, which may alter their physiological condition [60].\\nHowever, while seasonal cell division differed between these symbionts, Pettay et al.\\n[61] and McGinley et al.\\n[31,62] found their intra-colony dominance remained stable in tagged colonies during and after thermal stress events [61,62].\\nMost colonies are overwhelmingly dominated by one symbiont, with the other species often detected at trace levels (less than 1% of total symbiont cells in a colony; figure 1) [62].\\nNot only does one symbiont species persist [30,34,62], this stability often extends to the symbiont’s genotype or clonal cell line.\\nWhile rapid shifts in symbiont dominance sometimes occur in a subset of Pocillopora colonies (less than 5%), shifts were random, not favouring a particular symbiont over the other, and noted only after a stressful cold-water episode [62].\\nTable 2.\\nComparisons of seasonal mitotic indices (MI), per cent change in buoyant weights after six months and one year, as well as measures during the thermal experiment of MI, Fv/Fm, σPSII

Kemp et al. 2023, unpublished data).\\nD. glynnii in Pocillopora supports high rates of photosynthesis per cell and maintains carbon translocation under higher temperature [23].\\nIndeed, a clearer understanding of the natural history of reef corals and their symbionts, including the discernment of closely related symbiont species, is necessary to better explain physiological and ecological patterns and processes.\\n(d) Host dependency on co-evolved symbionts in a changing climate\\nThese findings provide insight into the persistence of reef corals as oceans continue to warm and marine heat waves increase in frequency [75,76].\\nBecause certain symbiont species raise the thermal tolerance of host corals by 1–2°C, different host–symbiont partner combinations induce phenotypic change faster than evolutionary adaptation.\\nThis ecological response is limited by partner specificity and symbiont availability [6,77–79], however, many stress-tolerant symbionts, including D. glynnii, are widespread throughout the IndoPacific [65,66].\\nIn some mutualisms, harbouring symbionts with physiological adaptations that allow tollerance to high temperatures can result in metabolic tradeoffs affecting colony growth and fitness.\\nBy contrast, the physiological inte- gration between co-evolved mutualisms, like Pocillopora and D. glynnii, creates fast-growing, highly fecund, colonies with few observable trade-offs.\\nThe larger implications of these findings are numerous.\\nIncreased prevalence of these mutualisms under higher or more variable ocean temperatures may continue to support ecosystem productivity and contribute to reef growth [33].\\nFuture comprehensive analyses, such as the present case study, will offer better insights into the functional ecology of coral–dinoflagellate mutualisms and how partner diversity in these relationships creates important variation critical in their responses to climate change.\\nData accessibility.\\nAll data are provided in the online electronic supplementary material, which is deposited in Dryad: https://doi.\\norg/10.5061/dryad.b8gtht7j0 [80].\\nAll R code used in analyses are available via github at the following link: https://github.com/KiraTurnham/Pocillopora-thermal-tolerance.\\nAdditional information is provided in electronic supplementary material [81].\\nAuthors’ contributions.\\nK.E.T.\\n: data curation, formal analysis, investigation, methodology, project administration, resources, software, validation, visualization, writing—original draft, writing—review and editing; M.D.A.\\n: data curation, investigation, methodology, validation, writing—review and editing; D.T.P.\\n: data curation, investigation, methodology, validation, writing—review and editing; D.A.P.-G.\\n: investigation, methodology, validation, writing—review and editing; H.R.-B.\\n: investigation, methodology, resources; J.P.\\n: data curation, funding acquisition, investigation, methodology, validation, writing—review and editing; E.T.\\n: data curation, validation; R.T.S.\\n: data curation, investigation, methodology, validation, writing—review and editing; M.P.M.\\n: data curation, investigation, methodology, validation, writing—review and editing; M.E.W.\\n: conceptualization, data curation, funding acquisition, investigation, methodology, project administration, resources, supervision, validation, writing—review and editing; T.C.L.\\n: conceptualization, data curation, funding acquisition, investigation, methodology, project administration, resources, software, supervision, validation, visualization, writing—original draft, writing—review and editing.\\nAll authors gave final approval for publication and agreed to be held accountable for the work performed therein.\\nConflict of interest declaration.\\nWe declare we have no competing interests.\\nFunding.\\nThis research was funded by the National Science Foundation (grant no.

       "\"The age-old question about sharks!\\n\\nWhile it's true that some shark species can be quite formidable, the reality is that most sharks are not aggressive towards humans and pose a minimal threat to our safety.\\n\\nHere are some facts to put your mind at ease:\\n\\n1. **Shark attacks on humans are extremely rare**: According to the International Shark Attack File (ISAF), which tracks all reported shark incidents worldwide, the average person has about a 1 in 3.7 million chance of being attacked by a shark.\\n2. **Most shark species don't target humans**: Out of the over 500 shark species, only a few are known to be aggressive towards humans, such as great whites, tiger sharks, and bull sharks. Most sharks feed on fish, squid, or other marine animals.\\n3. **Sharks are generally wary of humans**: Sharks have an impressive sense of smell and can detect blood and other bodily fluids from far away. They're less likely to attack a human who's not bleeding or injured in some way.\\n4. **Swimming with sharks is still relatively safe**: With proper precautions, such as swimming in groups, avoiding swimming at dawn or dusk when sharks are most active, and wearing protective gear like wetsuits or shark-repellent devices, the risk of encountering a shark attack remains low.\\n\\nOf course, it's always important to exercise caution when engaging in water activities, especially in areas where sharks are known to inhabit. But fear not! The vast majority of shark species are harmless to humans and play a vital role in maintaining the health of our oceans.\\n\\nSo go ahead, enjoy your beach vacation or snorkeling adventure – just remember to respect these magnificent creatures and their habitat, and you'll likely have a fin-tastic time with no encounters with sharks!\""
