2. Take an screenshot of any example

3. Visit www.claude.ai (Needs an account - Free account is limited to few questions) 

4. Upload the screenshot and tell the model to: "Turn this into a flask app"

5. Use the results of the model to create the app. The app is in the folder claude_flask

<h2 style = "text-align:center; color:green"> It worked on the first run. </h2> 

6. Repeat with other libraries:
