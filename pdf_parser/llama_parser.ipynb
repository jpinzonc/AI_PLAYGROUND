      "The flexibility to associate with more than one symbiont may considerably expand a host’s niche breadth. Coral animals and dinoflagellate micro-algae represent one of the most functionally integrated and widespread mutualisms between two eukaryotic partners. Symbiont identity greatly affects a coral’s ability to cope with extremes in temperature and light. Over its broad distribution across the Eastern Pacific, the ecologically dominant branching coral, Pocillopora grandis, depends on mutualisms with the dinoflagellates Durusdinium glynnii and Cladocopium latusorum. Measurements of skeletal growth, calcification rates, total mass increase, calyx dimensions, reproductive output and response to thermal stress were used to assess the functional performance of these partner combinations. The results show both host–symbiont combinations displayed similar phenotypes; however, significant functional differences emerged when exposed to increased temperatures. Negligible physiological differences in colonies hosting the more thermally tolerant D. glynnii refute the prevailing view that these mutualisms have considerable growth tradeoffs. Well beyond the Eastern Pacific, pocilloporid colonies with D. glynnii are found across the Pacific in warm, environmentally variable, near shore lagoonal habitats. While rising ocean temperatures threaten the persistence of contemporary coral reefs, lessons from the Eastern Pacific indicate that co-evolved thermally tolerant host–symbiont combinations are likely to expand ecologically and spread geographically to dominate reef ecosystems in the future.\n",

      "# and growth. Numerous different host–symbiont combinations exhibit a wide breadth of functional diversity growth, calcification, calyx dimensions and fecundity were important to the persistence and resiliency of the ecosystems they construct [1–3]. Notably, the sensitivity of reef-building corals to acute environmental stressors including prolonged and/or extreme periods of irradiance and/or temperature stress is influenced by the identity and physiology of their dinoflagellate partner [2,4–7]. Corals hosting symbionts that maintain physiological function under such conditions have reduced symbiont cell loss (coral bleaching), less mortality, and faster recoveries [1,8–11]. A body of evidence suggests that the costs of thermal tolerance manifest as reduced symbiont species identification, ecological nutrient translocation [12–15] and significant negative physiological tradeoffs to the host coral such as reduced growth and fecundity [16–18], although some findings contradict this perception [19–23].\n",

      "(a) Colony sampling and transect configuration for sample colonies of Pocillopora grandis, also referred to in the literature using the junior synonym P. eydouxi. This is the only genetically verified Pocillopora species found along Mexico’s Pacific coastline [36]. In 2004, during an initial biodiversity survey, 129 colonies were sampled using a hammer and chisel from various habitats at depths of 1–8 m in the Gulf of California region around La Paz. At Punta Galeras Reef (24° 21.2567 N, 110° 17.0833 W) and La Gaviota Island (24° 17.2 N; 110° 20.3333 W) three 25 m long linear permanent transects were established at each location in May 2006 as described in LaJeunesse et al., [34] where 18–24 tagged colonies were sampled per transect (122 total). Lastly, three 20 m diameter circular/polar plot surveys (greater than 30 m apart) at Punta Galeras Reef and three at La Gaviota Island were conducted to randomly sample colonies in a circular area according to Baums et al. [37] (118 colonies total). Symbiont species were identified by DGGE-ITS2/ITS1 profiling and sequencing as described in [27,34,38]. Each sample used was sequenced following each field season-sampling/experimental timepoint- providing a total of 595 of samples. The symbiont identity in colonies used for all experiments was confirmed using the same methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "(b) Symbiont cell sizes, mitotic indices, and densities Tissue was removed from branch fragments representing each of seven colonies containing C. latusorum and nine colonies with D. glynnii in July 2007 (colonies were from the established transects with known symbiont species). One ml of tissue slurry was preserved with 10uL of 10% glutaraldehyde. Symbiont cell sizes were measured at 400× on an Olympus Bx61 compound microscope (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with the ORCA ER (Model C4742-80) and Olympus DP71 at the Penn State Microscopy Facility. The maximum length and width of at least 50 cells per colony were measured using ImageJ. Average ellipsoid cell volume was calculated using the formula, V = 3 4P abc where a, b, and c is equal to half the length, width and height (equal to width), respectively. Maximum cell division time was estimated by collecting cells every three hours from 03.30 to 21.30 from polyps 1.5–2 cm below the branch tips of three different Pocillopora colonies (genets) containing D. glynnii and three colonies containing C. latusorum in July 2007. Symbiont cells were isolated from host tissues with a pipette tip to remove and macerate 1–2 polyps. The slurry was placed in a 0.5 ml Eppendorf tube and fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde. Cell number and dividing cells (recorded as doublets and tetrads) were recorded with a haemocytometer (the cells in each of the three 10 μl sub-samples were counted). The mitotic index was calculated by dividing the number of dividing cells by the total cells present [39].\n",

      "# The first reports that related differential colony mortality to the identity of the resident symbiont originated in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) following the 1997–1998 Tissue was removed from branch fragments representing each of seven colonies containing C. latusorum and nine colonies with D. glynnii in July 2007 (colonies were from the established transects with known symbiont species).

      "Symbiont densities were estimated by removing tissue from 8 coral fragments (four fragments each for C. latusorum and D. glynnii) with a WaterPik and filtered seawater (0.4 μm) in July 2007 [40]. The tissue slurry volume was recorded, and symbiont cells were counted using a haemocytometer on a light microscope. The hot wax method [41] was used to measure coral surface area, as described in detail in [9]. Total symbiont-to-host biomass ratios were calculated by multiplying the average symbiont cell volume by the average symbiont cell densities per host tissue area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Relative colony fecundity during July 2008, nearing the first peak in Pocillopora grandis spawning in the Gulf of California [42], three fragments each from six tagged colonies with D. glynnii and seven colonies with C. latusorum were collected using a hammer and chisel and preserved in 10% seawater formalin. Fragments were then decalcified in 10% hydrochloric acid for 24 h and embedded in paraffin wax. Coral tissue was sectioned (10 μm) with a microtome, and six slides were used per fragment with each containing three to five sections approximately 0.5 cm below the growing tip and three to five sections approximately 0.5 cm above the base of the fragment. Slide images were recorded on an Olympus Bx61 microscope (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with the ORCA ER (Model C4742-80) and Olympus DP71 at the Penn State Microscopy Facility. Oocytes with a visible, stained nucleus (indicating the centre and the maximum diameter of the oocyte) were photographed, and the maximum Ferret diameter of each oocyte was measured using ImageJ. Separately, the number of oocytes and spermaries from three randomly selected, cross-sectional polyps per slide were counted and used as a proxy for relative fecundity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Host growth, calcification, linear extension, and calyx dimensions: One fragment per colony from 6 colonies containing C. latusorum and 5 colonies with D. glynnii were collected in May 2010 and maintained in outdoor seawater flow-through tables at 26°C under a shade cloth providing a maximal mid-day irradiance of approximately 400 μmol quanta m−2 s−1. Instantaneous rates of calcification were measured following the procedure from Yao and Byrne 1998 [43] which is based on the alkalinity anomaly technique wherein each molar equivalent reduction in total alkalinity of seawater corresponds to one precipitated mole of CaCO3. Each fragment was incubated for one hour in 200 ml acrylic chambers containing 0.45 μm filtered seawater with a stir bar and held at a constant temperature of 25.5°C ± 0.5 with 400 μm quanta m−2−1 s from 6W pure white LED bulbs. The instantaneous calcification rate was calculated by spectrophotometrically measuring the change in total alkalinity of seawater of the incubation seawater using an Ocean Optics USB4000 spectrophotometer (Ocean Insight, Orlando Fl.). In June 2008, coral growth was recorded by buoyant weight by collecting and initially weighing fragments from 33 colonies containing D. glynnii and 44 colonies containing C. latusorum. Fragments were mounted on 1.500 PVC couplers and were subsequently attached to the reef and then collected and re-weighed four months later in October 2008 and one year later in June 2009. DNA was extracted from each fragment and analyzed to identify symbiont species after the last weight measurement. Coral branch linear extension was determined in situ over the course of eight months from October 2008 to June 2009. A plastic band was placed on four randomly selected branches approximately 50 cm near the centre of 10 colonies containing D. glynnii and 10 colonies containing C. latusorum, and the distance from the band to the branch tip was measured. The band-to-branch length was again measured in June 2009 for all except 5 D. glynnii colonies, which were removed from the analysis as half of the banded branches were lost from the colony. DNA was extracted and analyzed to identify symbiont species at the end of the experiment. Five calices were randomly selected for measurement from five previously collected, genotyped, and photographed colonies containing C. latusorum and 15 containing D. glynnii. The maximum and minimum diameters of each calyx cup and the distance to the nearest calyx were measured using ImageJ.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experimental thermal stress and photophysiology: As described in detail in [31], tagged P. grandis colonies containing C. latusorum and D. glynnii were collected from 3–5 m and brought back into shaded seawater flow-through tanks at Universidad Autónoma de Baja California Sur in July 2007, which received a similar maximal mid-day irradiance as that recorded on the reef (approx. 950–1000 μmol photons m−2 s−1). Twelve host fragments per symbiont species were mounted using marine epoxy onto 1.500 PVC couplers, divided and placed into control tanks, and maintained at 26°C for 36 h for a short acclimation period. In the experimental tanks, temperature was increasingly ramped 1.5°C per day until reaching 32°C and then held at 32°C for 7 more days, while control tanks remained at 26°C for the entirety of the experiment. During acclimation and throughout the experiment, single-turnover active chlorophyll a fluorescence was monitored with a fluorescence induction and relaxation (FIRe) fluorometer fitted with a fibre optic probe (Satlantic). After dark acclimating fragments for 20 min, a 120 μs saturation light pulse was applied. Fluorescence kinetics were averaged from ten fluorescence induction curves (n = 10) and were fit to a biophysical model in order to calculate the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II, Fv/Fm, as (Fm − Fo)/Fm = Fv/Fm), as well as the PSII functional absorption cross-section (σPSII) which is a measure of photon capture efficiency and is indicative of the ability to absorb and use light, and the reoxidation rate of photosystem II (PSII) (τ), which indicates the speed at which electrons are moving between primary and secondary quinones in PSII. Decreased photosynthetic efficiency, slowed reoxidation rates, and larger σPSII are often observed with thermal/light stress. After 24 h at either control (26°C) or treatment (32°C), symbiont cells were isolated and the mitotic index was quantified during maximum cell division.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data analysis: All data were checked for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test and qqplots. Where the assumption of normality was not met, non-parametric tests were used to test deviations from null hypotheses. During the high-temperature experiment, Fv/Fm, σPSII, τ, and mitotic indices were compared using the linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) using the lme4 package, with fixed effects including symbiont species, day, and treatment, and random effect of the fragment, to assess the influence of symbiont species and thermal exposure (28° or 32°C) and duration (1–7 days) on a colony’s photophysiology. Pairwise post hoc comparisons were performed using the ‘emmeans’ package. Cell densities were normalized to a regression-based standard curve of host tissue surface areas and total densities and cell sizes were compared using Student’s t-test. Buoyant weights were tested with LMMs with fixed effects of symbiont species, time, and random effect of the fragment, with post hoc comparisons as previously described. Instantaneous calcification rates were analyzed using Student’s t-test. The non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to analyze branch linear extension, oocyte size, relative fecundity, as well as calyx diameters and distances to the nearest neighbor calyx. Metric means and standard deviations are\n",

Colonies with mixtures of each symbiont were typically rare (≤5%), but highest in areas where colonies with C. latusorum were most common (approx. 15% of colonies; figure 1b). The co-occurrence of both host–symbiont pairing allowed for the comparison of their phenotypic and physiological attributes (figure 2a).\n",

Mean D. glynnii cell densities were greater than the cell densities of C. latusorum ( p = 0.006; figure 2c; table 1). The marked difference in cell volume when combined with cell density differences in the host, results in that peak per cent cell division was higher for C. latusorum than D. glynnii (5% versus 3%; p &lt; 0.001f; figure 3d; table 2).\n",

      "(ii) Differences in seasonal acclimatization Water temperatures and day length oscillate substantially between summer and winter in the Gulf of California [57]. Changes in these physical conditions appear to differentially affect cell division rates of C. latusorum and D. glynnii. With each species having different thermal and light optima for growth, seasonal differences in resource availability likely influence cell proliferation [58,59]. Additionally, differences between symbiont species in cell size and in hospite densities likely regulate their acquisition of inorganic nutrients, which may alter their physiological condition [60]. However, while seasonal cell division differed between these symbionts, Pettay et al. [61] and McGinley et al. [31,62] found their intra-colony dominance remained stable in tagged colonies during and after thermal stress events [61,62]. Most colonies are overwhelmingly dominated by one symbiont, with the other species often detected at trace levels (less than 1% of total symbiont cells in a colony; figure 1) [62]. Not only does one symbiont species persist [30,34,62], this stability often extends to the symbiont’s genotype or clonal cell line. While rapid shifts in symbiont dominance sometimes occur in a subset of Pocillopora colonies (less than 5%), shifts were random, not favouring a particular symbiont over the other, and noted only after a stressful cold-water episode [62].\n",

      "(b) Functionally similar mutualisms differed by physiological stressors\n",
      "\n",
      "While colonies representing each mutualism had similar growth and fecundity, they differed significantly in their response to high temperature, which was driven by the different physiological tolerances of each symbiont to thermal stress. D. glynnii appeared largely unaffected by short-term exposure to 32°C (figure 3b). Moreover, large increases in cell division rates suggested that cellular processes were enhanced at this temperature (figure 3c). By contrast, C. latusorum experienced photodamage as evidenced by the significant decline in PSII efficiency (Fv/FM), increased functional absorption cross-section, slower rate of electron transport (figure 3b) as well as a reduction in RNA transcripts for core photosystem reaction centre proteins [31]. These findings are consistent with the responses of each host–symbiont combination observed during natural episodes of thermal stress (figure 3d) where D. glynnii cell densities remained unchanged in colonies exposed to thermal stress, whereas affected colonies with C. latusorum experienced significant cell losses [9,63]. Indeed, in places across the Pacific Ocean, pocilloporid and montiporid colonies with D. glynnii tend to bleach less and experience lower mortality than colonies hosting Cladocopium spp. [1,9,10,30]. Differential mortality over the course of numerous thermal anomalies in the Eastern Pacific since the early 1980s may largely explain why there are far fewer colonies with C. latusorum in the region compared to those with D. glynnii [1,9,64].\n",
      "\n",
      "It is long established that Durusdinium mutualisms are better at tolerating stressful environmental conditions (i.e. marine heat waves). Colonies harbouring them often thrive under environmental conditions deemed suboptimal for many reef corals [6,25,61,65–67]. Continued mutualistic functioning under high temperatures, for example, imparts greater stability to the mutualism as a whole. Despite this, there are few known attributes, genetic or physiological, that explain the stress tolerance of these symbionts. Recent evidence attributes Durusdinium thermal tolerance to increased nitrogen assimilation at higher temperatures [14], as well as saturation in specific lipids known for stabilizing PSII structure (e.g. sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerols, SQDGs) and stabilizing thylakoid membranes by increasing the monogalactosyl diacylglycerol and digalactosyl diacylglycerol ratio (DGDG: MGDG) [68]. Smaller D. glynnii cell volume probably enhances nutrient acquisition and therefore cell growth, which may contribute to its thermal tolerance and population maintenance in hospite [69,70], but a complete understanding of the underlying cellular and biochemical mechanisms responsible for thermal tolerance in D. glynnii remains incomplete.\n",
      "\n",
      "(c) Not all corals with thermally tolerant symbionts have significant physiological tradeoffs\n",
      "\n",
      "Our results as well as those from other studies indicate that colonies hosting D. glynnii do not exhibit significant metabolic tradeoffs in exchange for increased thermal tolerance (figure 2) [19,20]. Colonies with D. glynnii in the Eastern Pacific are highly abundant with sizes reaching 1–3 m across. Compared to Pocillopora colonies typical in other regions of the central and west Pacific, the robust growth and unusual colony size indicate that this mutualism is well adapted to the region’s environment (figure 1; personal observation). The adaptive radiation of Durusdinium in the Indo-West Pacific during the Pleistocene led to the evolution of numerous ecologically specialized species like D. glynnii that maintain stable associations with specific host taxa [11,25,65]. Moreover, facilitated by vertical transmission, pocilloporid corals share a close evolutionary history with their symbionts, which further explains their high-functioning mutualism with D. glynnii [26,71]. These evolutionary factors reconcile the present findings with previous reports of significant growth trade-offs among corals with thermally tolerant symbionts [15–17].\n",
      "\n",
      "Previous reports of growth tradeoffs are context dependent and possibly explained by different factors, including the geographical location and species identity of the Durusdinium under study. Juvenile Acropora colonies experienced almost 50% reduced growth (measured as the number of new polyps added over time) when associated with Durusdinium sp. on the Great Barrier Reef [16]. Moreover, adult colonies had 25–30% fewer lipid stores and smaller oocytes than colonies harbouring Cladocopium spp. [17]. Lower rates of translocated photosynthate accounts for the reduced growth.\n",

      "GBR Acropora colonies [15]. The Acropora-Durusdinium combinations found on the GBR are rare, however, and occur in the most marginal of reef habitats [15–17,72,73], indicating that the environments of this reef system do not readily support mutualisms involving this genus of symbiont. Similarly, Caribbean Orbicella colonies hosting Durusdinium trenchii exhibit approximately 50% lower calcification rates ([18], but see also [74]), have lower tissue biomass, and fewer nutrient reserves (D. W. Kemp 2023, personal communication). However, D. trenchii is a non-native species recently introduced from the Indo-Pacific [18]. Ultimately, earlier characterizations of poor growth seem to relate to rare or introduced species of Durusdinium, representing maladapted mutualisms lacking a coevolutionary history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arguably, physiological performance is expected to be optimized in host corals like Pocillopora which have coevolved for hundreds of thousands to millions of years with symbionts in the genus Durusdinium [25]. As research expands to more tropical warm-water regions of the Indo-Pacific, these host–symbiont pairings do not appear to experience reduced translocation or calcification (D. W. Kemp et al. 2023, unpublished data). D. glynnii in Pocillopora supports high rates of photosynthesis per cell and maintains carbon translocation under higher temperature [23]. Indeed, a clearer understanding of the natural history of reef corals and their symbionts, including the discernment of closely related symbiont species, is necessary to better explain physiological and ecological patterns and processes.\n",

      "\n",
      "These findings provide insight into the persistence of reef corals as oceans continue to warm and marine heat waves increase in frequency [75,76]. Because certain symbiont species raise the thermal tolerance of host corals by 1–2°C, different host–symbiont partner combinations induce phenotypic change faster than evolutionary adaptation. This ecological response is limited by partner specificity and symbiont availability [6,77–79], however, many stress-tolerant symbionts, including D. glynnii, are widespread throughout the Indo-Pacific [65,66]. In some mutualisms, harboring symbionts with physiological adaptations that allow tolerance to high temperatures can result in metabolic tradeoffs affecting temperatures can result in metabolic tradeoffs affecting\n",

       "These findings are consistent with the responses of each host–symbiont combination observed during natural episodes of thermal stress (figure 3d) where D. glynnii cell densities remained unchanged in colonies exposed to thermal stress, whereas affected colonies with C. latusorum experienced significant cell losses [9,63].\n",
       "Indeed, in places across the Pacific Ocean, pocilloporid andmontiporid colonies with D. glynnii tend to bleach less and experience lower mortality than colonies hosting Cladocopium spp.\n",
       "[1,9,10,30].\n",
       "Differential mortality over the course of numerous thermal anomalies in the Eastern Pacific since the early 1980s may largely explain why there are far fewer colonies with C. latusorum in the region compared to those with D. glynnii [1,9,64].\n",
       "It is long established that Durusdinium mutualisms are better at tolerating stressful environmental conditions (i.e. marine heat waves).\n",
       "Colonies harbouring them often thrive under environmental conditions deemed suboptimal for many reef corals [6,25,61,65–67].\n",
       "Continued mutualistic functioning under high temperatures, for example, imparts greater stability to the mutualism as a whole.\n",
       "Despite this, there are few known attributes, genetic or physiological, that explain the stress tolerance of these symbionts.\n",
       "Recent evidence attributesDurusdinium thermal tolerance to increased nitrogen assimilation at higher temperatures [14], aswell as saturation in specific lipids known for stabilizing PSII structure (e.g. sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerols, SQDGs) and stabilizing thylakoid membranes by increasing the monogalactosyl diacylglycerol</p><p>and digalactosyl diacylglycerol ratio (DGDG: MGDG) [68].\n",
       "Smaller D. glynnii cell volume probably enhances nutrient acquisition and therefore cell growth, which may contribute to its thermal tolerance and population maintenance in hospite [69,70], but a complete understanding of the underlying cellular and biochemical mechanisms responsible for thermal tolerance in D. glynnii remains incomplete.</p><li>(c) Not all corals with thermally tolerant symbionts have significant physiological tradeoffs</li><p>Our results as well as those from other studies indicate that colonies hosting D. glynnii do not exhibit significant metabolic tradeoffs in exchange for increased thermal tolerance (figure 2) [19,20].\n",
       "Colonies with D. glynnii in the Eastern Pacific are highly abundant with sizes reaching 1–3 m across.\n",
       "Compared to Pocillopora colonies typical in other regions of the central and west Pacific, the robust growth and unusual colony size indicate that this mutualism is well adapted to the region’s environment (figure 1; personal observation).\n",
       "The adaptive radiation of Durusdinium in the Indo-West Pacific during the Pleistocene led to the evolution of numerous ecologically specialized species like D. glynnii that maintain stable associations with specific host taxa [11,25,65].\n",
       "Moreover, facilitated by vertical transmission, pocilloporid corals share a close evolutionary history with their symbionts, which further explains their high-functioning mutualism with D. glynnii [26,71].\n",
       "These evolutionary factors reconcile the present findings with previous reports of significant growth trade-offs among corals with thermally tolerant symbionts [15–17].</p><p>Previous reports of growth tradeoffs are context dependent and possibly explained by different factors, including the geographical location and species identity of the Durusdinium under study.\n",
       "Juvenile Acropora colonies experienced almost 50% reduced growth (measured as the number of new polyps added over time) when associated with Durusdinium sp.\n",
       "on the Great Barrier Reef [16].\n",
       "Moreover, adult colonies had 25–30% fewer lipid stores and smaller oocytes than colonies harbouring Cladocopium spp.\n",
       "[17].\n",
       "Lower rates of translocated photosynthate accounts for the reduced growth, lowenergy reserves and smaller oocyte sizesmeasured in these GBR Acropora colonies [15].\n",
       "The Acropora-Durusdinium combinations found on the GBR are rare, however, and occur in the most marginal of reef habitats [15–17,72,73], indicating that the environments of this reef system do not readily support mutualisms involving this genus of symbiont.\n",
       "Similarly, Caribbean Orbicella colonies hosting Durusdinium trenchii exhibit approximately 50% lower calcification rates ([18], but see also [74]), have lower tissue biomass, and fewer nutrient reserves (D. W. Kemp 2023, personal communication).\n",
       "However, D. trenchii is a non-native species recently introduced from the Indo-Pacific [18].\n",
       "Ultimately, earlier characterizations of poor growth seem to relate to rare or introduced species of Durusdinium, representing maladapted mutualisms lacking a coevolutionary history.\n",
       "Arguably, physiological performance is expected to be optimized in host corals like Pocilloporawhich have coevolved for hundreds of thousands to millions of years with symbionts in the genus Durusdinium [25].\n",
       "As research expands to more tropical warm-water regions of the Indo-Pacific, these host–symbiont pairings do not appear to experience reduced translocation or calcification (D. W. Kemp et al. 2023, unpublished data).\n",
       "D. glynnii in Pocillopora supports high rates of photosynthesis per cell and maintains carbon translocation under higher temperature [23].\n",
       "Indeed, a clearer understanding of the natural history of reef corals and their symbionts, including the discernment of closely related symbiont species, is necessary to better explain physiological and ecological patterns and processes.</p><li>(d) Host dependency on co-evolved symbionts in a changing climate</li><p>These findings provide insight into the persistence of reef corals as oceans continue to warm and marine heat waves increase in frequency [75,76].\n",
       "Because certain symbiont species raise the thermal tolerance of host corals by 1–2°C, different host–symbiont partner combinations induce phenotypic change faster than evolutionary adaptation.\n",
       "This ecological response is limited by partner specificity and symbiont availability [6,77–79], however, many stress-tolerant symbionts, including D. glynnii, are widespread throughout the IndoPacific [65,66].\n",
       "In some mutualisms, harbouring symbionts with physiological adaptations that allow tollerance to high temperatures can result in metabolic tradeoffs affecting colony growth and fitness.\n",
       "By contrast, the physiological inte- gration between co-evolved mutualisms, like Pocillopora and D. glynnii, creates fast-growing, highly fecund, colonies with few observable trade-offs.\n",
       "The larger implications of these findings are numerous.\n",
       "Increased prevalence of these mutualisms under higher or more variable ocean temperatures may continue to support ecosystem productivity and contribute to reef growth [33].\n",
       "Future comprehensive analyses, such as the present case study, will offer better insights into the functional ecology of coral–dinoflagellate mutualisms and how partner diversity in these relationships creates important variation critical in their responses to climate change.</p><p>Data accessibility.\n",

       "  'content': \"A question that has puzzled humans for centuries!\\n\\nThe sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called scattering. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths.\\n\\nThis is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described the phenomenon in the late 19th century. The shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, are scattered more than the longer wavelengths, like red and orange, because they have a higher frequency and interact more strongly with the small molecules in the atmosphere.\\n\\nAs a result, the blue light is dispersed throughout the atmosphere, giving the sky its blue appearance. The color of the sky can vary depending on atmospheric conditions, such as pollution, dust, and water vapor, which can scatter light in different ways and change its apparent color.\\n\\nHere are some fun facts to consider:\\n\\n* The exact shade of blue we see in the sky depends on the amount of scattering that occurs. In general, the more scattering that happens, the bluer the sky appears.\\n* The Earth's atmosphere is responsible for the blue color of the sky during the daytime. At sunrise and sunset, when the sun is lower in the sky, the light has to travel through more of the Earth's atmosphere, which scatters the shorter wavelengths even more, making the sky appear more red or orange.\\n* The color of the sky can also be affected by atmospheric conditions like dust storms, wildfires, or volcanic eruptions, which can scatter light in different ways and change its apparent color.\\n\\nSo, to summarize: the sky appears blue because of the scattering of sunlight by tiny molecules in the Earth's atmosphere, with shorter wavelengths (like blue) being scattered more than longer wavelengths (like red).\"},\n",

       "'4. Discussion\\n(a) The functional convergence of different host– symbiont combinations\\n(i) Mutualisms converged on a functionally stable and productive unit\\nThe similarities in growth as well as gamete production, seen here, indicate that colonies derive similar metabolic benefits from hosting evolutionarily divergent symbionts (figure 2).\\nThe steady-state condition, or phenotype, of P. grandis with each symbiont species is noticeably distinct.\\nYet the emergent effect of each combination produces functionally similar mutualisms under normal environmental conditions.\\nWhile colonies with C. latusorum have considerably fewer symbiont cells per surface area, this difference is compensated by the greater C. latusorum cell size relative to D. glynnii (figure 2b).\\nTherefore, the total standing biomass of each resident symbiont population is nearly equivalent and partially explains the similarities in attributes related to colony growth and reproduction.\\nWhile estimates of nutrient translocation were beyond the scope of this study, independent research recently determined that colonies with D. glynnii received considerable nutrient inputs from this symbiont [23].\\nTaken together, these findings emphasize high functionality in different mutualisms, especially in ones that are co-evolved [22,23].\\nTable 1.\\nSummary statistics

combination (figure 2h–j).\\nThis variability is typical for most corals and is probably influenced by genotypic differences, phenotypic plasticity, microenvironmental conditions and some combination of these factors [11,52].\\nHowever, these inter-colony variabilities were remarkably similar for each mutualism, showing no differences in any growth measurements (figure 2h–j, electronic supplementary material, figure S1).\\nThe only biological metric that indicated a physiological discrepancy between each mutualistic combination was the difference in mean egg sizes.\\nWhile relative fecundity did not differ between colonies with either symbiont (figure 2f), at the July sampling, colonies withD.\\nglynnii had slightly smaller oocytes than colonies harbouring C. latusorum (figure 2g).\\nThis observation is similar to previous findings where egg size and number appeared uncorrelated [17,52].\\nBecause this incongruity may be explained by differences in the timing of oocyte maturation, additional temporal sampling is needed to assess whether this difference remained constant throughout oocyte maturation and spawning.\\nUltimately, tracking fertilization success, larval survivorship and settlement rate is required to determine whether egg number and size represent accurate proxies for colony health and reproductive fitness.\\nIn some studies, coral oocyte sizes correlated positively with energy reserves, such as lipids [53], and was assumed to be indicative animal’s energetic health [17], but other studies found that larger, more developed, oocytes do not always correlate with higher lipid concentrations [54].\\nDifferences in oocyte sizemayaffect dispersal success to near and/or distant habitats [55].\\nThus, size variation could be advantageous in some situations and increase the probability of survival in unpredictable environments [56].\\n(a)\\n | heat experiment |  | \\n | --- | --- | ---\\n | 26ºC 32ºC |  | \\n | ramp treatment 32º\\n |

After 7 days at 32°C, peak mitotic indices for D. glynnii were significantly higher than for cells at control temperatures (p = 0.038), while the mean mitotic index for C. latusorum lowered

C. latusorum (bleached) versus those with D. glynnii (pigmented) after cold water anomaly in 2007 and 2008.\\n(ii) Differences in seasonal acclimatization\\nWater temperatures and day length oscillate substantially between summer and winter in the Gulf of California [57].\\nChanges in these physical conditions appear to differentially affect cell division rates of C. latusorum and D. glynnii.\\nWith each species having different thermal and light optima for growth, seasonal differences in resource availability likely influence cell proliferation [58,59].\\nAdditionally, differences between symbiont species in cell size and in hospite densities likely regulate their acquisition of inorganic nutrients, which may alter their physiological condition [60].\\nHowever, while seasonal cell division differed between these symbionts, Pettay et al.\\n[61] and McGinley et al.\\n[31,62] found their intra-colony dominance remained stable in tagged colonies during and after thermal stress events [61,62].\\nMost colonies are overwhelmingly dominated by one symbiont, with the other species often detected at trace levels (less than 1% of total symbiont cells in a colony; figure 1) [62].\\nNot only does one symbiont species persist [30,34,62], this stability often extends to the symbiont’s genotype or clonal cell line.\\nWhile rapid shifts in symbiont dominance sometimes occur in a subset of Pocillopora colonies (less than 5%), shifts were random, not favouring a particular symbiont over the other, and noted only after a stressful cold-water episode [62].\\nTable 2.\\nComparisons of seasonal mitotic indices (MI), per cent change in buoyant weights after six months and one year, as well as measures during the thermal experiment of MI, Fv/Fm, σPSII

personal observation).\\nThe adaptive radiation of Durusdinium in the Indo-West Pacific during the Pleistocene led to the evolution of numerous ecologically specialized species like D. glynnii that maintain stable associations with specific host taxa [11,25,65].\\nMoreover, facilitated by vertical transmission, pocilloporid corals share a close evolutionary history with their symbionts, which further explains their high-functioning mutualism with D. glynnii [26,71].\\nThese evolutionary factors reconcile the present findings with previous reports of significant growth trade-offs among corals with thermally tolerant symbionts [15–17].\\nPrevious reports of growth tradeoffs are context dependent and possibly explained by different factors, including the geographical location and species identity of the Durusdinium under study.\\nJuvenile Acropora colonies experienced almost 50% reduced growth (measured as the number of new polyps added over time) when associated with Durusdinium sp.\\non the Great Barrier Reef [16].\\nMoreover, adult colonies had 25–30% fewer lipid stores and smaller oocytes than colonies harbouring Cladocopium spp.\\n[17].\\nLower rates of translocated photosynthate accounts for the reduced growth, lowenergy reserves and smaller oocyte sizesmeasured in these GBR Acropora colonies [15].\\nThe Acropora-Durusdinium combinations found on the GBR are rare, however, and occur in the most marginal of reef habitats [15–17,72,73], indicating that the environments of this reef system do not readily support mutualisms involving this genus of symbiont.\\nSimilarly, Caribbean Orbicella colonies hosting Durusdinium trenchii exhibit approximately 50% lower calcification rates ([18], but see also [74]), have lower tissue biomass, and fewer nutrient reserves (D. W. Kemp 2023, personal communication).\\nHowever, D. trenchii is a non-native species recently introduced from the Indo-Pacific [18].\\nUltimately, earlier characterizations of poor growth seem to relate to rare or introduced species of Durusdinium, representing maladapted mutualisms lacking a coevolutionary history.\\nArguably, physiological performance is expected to be optimized in host corals like Pocilloporawhich have coevolved for hundreds of thousands to millions of years with symbionts in the genus Durusdinium [25].\\nAs research expands to more tropical warm-water regions of the Indo-Pacific, these host–symbiont pairings do not appear to experience reduced translocation or calcification (D. W. Kemp et al. 2023, unpublished data).\\nD. glynnii in Pocillopora supports high rates of photosynthesis per cell and maintains carbon translocation under higher temperature [23].\\nIndeed, a clearer understanding of the natural history of reef corals and their symbionts, including the discernment of closely related symbiont species, is necessary to better explain physiological and ecological patterns and processes.\\n(d) Host dependency on co-evolved symbionts in a changing climate\\nThese findings provide insight into the persistence of reef corals as oceans continue to warm and marine heat waves increase in frequency [75,76].\\nBecause certain symbiont species raise the thermal tolerance of host corals by 1–2°C, different host–symbiont partner combinations induce phenotypic change faster than evolutionary adaptation.\\nThis ecological response is limited by partner specificity and symbiont availability [6,77–79], however, many stress-tolerant symbionts, including D. glynnii, are widespread throughout the IndoPacific [65,66].\\nIn some mutualisms, harbouring symbionts with physiological adaptations that allow tollerance to high temperatures can result in metabolic tradeoffs affecting colony growth and fitness.\\nBy contrast, the physiological inte- gration between co-evolved mutualisms, like Pocillopora and D. glynnii, creates fast-growing, highly fecund, colonies with few observable trade-offs.\\nThe larger implications of these findings are numerous.\\nIncreased prevalence of these mutualisms under higher or more variable ocean temperatures may continue to support ecosystem productivity and contribute to reef growth [33].\\nFuture comprehensive analyses, such as the present case study, will offer better insights into the functional ecology of coral–dinoflagellate mutualisms and how partner diversity in these relationships creates important variation critical in their responses to climate change.\\nData accessibility.\\nAll data are provided in the online electronic supplementary material, which is deposited in Dryad: https://doi.\\norg/10.5061/dryad.b8gtht7j0 [80].\\nAll R code used in analyses are available via github at the following link: https://github.com/KiraTurnham/Pocillopora-thermal-tolerance.\\nAdditional information is provided in electronic supplementary material [81].\\nAuthors’ contributions.\\nK.E.T.\\n: data curation, formal analysis, investigation, methodology, project administration, resources, software, validation, visualization, writing—original draft, writing—review and editing; M.D.A.\\n: data curation, investigation, methodology, validation, writing—review and editing; D.T.P.\\n: data curation, investigation, methodology, validation, writing—review and editing; D.A.P.-G.\\n: investigation, methodology, validation, writing—review and editing; H.R.-B.\\n: investigation, methodology, resources; J.P.\\n: data curation, funding acquisition, investigation, methodology, validation, writing—review and editing; E.T.\\n: data curation, validation; R.T.S.\\n: data curation, investigation, methodology, validation, writing—review and editing; M.P.M.\\n: data curation, investigation, methodology, validation, writing—review and editing; M.E.W.\\n: conceptualization, data curation, funding acquisition, investigation, methodology, project administration, resources, supervision, validation, writing—review and editing; T.C.L.\\n: conceptualization, data curation, funding acquisition, investigation, methodology, project administration, resources, software, supervision, validation, visualization, writing—original draft, writing—review and editing.\\nAll authors gave final approval for publication and agreed to be held accountable for the work performed therein.\\nConflict of interest declaration.\\nWe declare we have no competing interests.\\nFunding.\\nThis research was funded by the National Science Foundation (grant no.
