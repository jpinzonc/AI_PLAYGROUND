The flexibility to associate with more than one symbiont may considerably expand a host’s niche breadth. Coral animals and dinoflagellate micro-algae represent one of the most functionally integrated and widespread mutualisms between two eukaryotic partners. Symbiont identity greatly affects a coral’s ability to cope with extremes in temperature and light. Over its broad distribution across the Eastern Pacific, the ecologically dominant branching coral, Pocillopora grandis, depends on mutualisms with the dinoflagellates Durusdinium glynnii and Cladocopium latusorum. Measurements of skeletal growth, calcification rates, total mass increase, calyx dimensions, reproductive output and response to thermal stress were used to assess the functional performance of these partner combinations. The results show both host–symbiont combinations displayed similar phenotypes; however, significant functional differences emerged when exposed to increased temperatures. Negligible physiological differences in colonies hosting the more thermally tolerant D. glynnii refute the prevailing view that these mutualisms have considerable growth tradeoffs. Well beyond the Eastern Pacific, pocilloporid colonies with D. glynnii are found across the Pacific in warm, environmentally variable, near shore lagoonal habitats. While rising ocean temperatures threaten the persistence of contemporary coral reefs, lessons from the Eastern Pacific indicate that co-evolved thermally tolerant host–symbiont combinations are likely to expand ecologically and spread geographically to dominate reef ecosystems in the future.

# Introduction

Symbioses profoundly influence the diversity, ecology, and evolution of life on Earth. In particular, mutualisms function through reciprocal exploitation that ultimately provides net benefits to each partner, with the resulting functionality of the unit constrained to the attributes of each partner. Reef-building corals depend on nutrients translocated from endosymbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellates in the family Symbiodiniaceae for survival

# and growth. Numerous different host–symbiont combinations exhibit a wide breadth of functional diversity growth, calcification, calyx dimensions and fecundity were examined to evaluate how different symbiont species affect the host animal’s well-being and reveal possible metabolic trade-offs associated with thermal tolerance.

important to the persistence and resiliency of the ecosystems they construct [1–3]. Notably, the sensitivity of reef-building corals to acute environmental stressors including prolonged and/or extreme periods of irradiance and/or temperature stress is influenced by the identity and physiology of their dinoflagellate partner [2,4–7]. Corals hosting symbionts that maintain physiological function under such conditions have reduced symbiont cell loss (coral bleaching), less mortality, and faster recoveries [1,8–11]. A body of evidence suggests that the costs of thermal tolerance manifest as reduced nutrient translocation [12–15] and significant negative physiological tradeoffs to the host coral such as reduced growth and fecundity [16–18], although some findings contradict this perception [19–23].

# 2. Methods

(a) Colony sampling and transect configuration for symbiont species identification, ecological prevalence and within-host abundance conducted independent sampling methods were to sample colonies of Pocillopora grandis, also referred to in the literature using the junior synonym P. eydouxi. This is the only genetically verified Pocillopora species found along Mexico’s Pacific coastline [36]. In 2004, during an initial biodiversity survey, 129 colonies were sampled using a hammer and chisel from various habitats at depths of 1–8 m in the Gulf of California region around La Paz. At Punta Galeras Reef (24° 21.2567 N, 110° 17.0833 W) and La Gaviota Island (24° 17.2 N; 110° 20.3333 W) three 25 m long linear permanent transects were established at each location in May 2006 as described in LaJeunesse et al., [34] where 18–24 tagged colonies were sampled per transect (122 total). Lastly, three 20 m diameter circular/polar plot surveys (greater than 30 m apart) at Punta Galeras Reef and three at La Gaviota Island were conducted to randomly sample colonies in a circular area according to Baums et al. [37] (118 colonies total) [37]. Symbiont species were identified by DGGE-ITS2/ITS1 profiling and sequencing as described in [27,34,38]. Each sample used was sequenced following each field season-sampling/experimental timepoint- providing a total of 595 of samples. The symbiont identity in colonies used for all experiments was confirmed using the same methods.

(b) Symbiont cell sizes, mitotic indices, and densities Tissue was removed from branch fragments representing each of seven colonies containing C. latusorum and nine colonies with D. glynnii in July 2007 (colonies were from the established transects with known symbiont species). One ml of tissue slurry was preserved with 10uL of 10% glutaraldehyde. Symbiont cell sizes were measured at 400× on an Olympus Bx61 compound microscope (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with the ORCA ER (Model C4742-80) and Olympus DP71 at the Penn State Microscopy Facility. The maximum length and width of at least 50 cells per colony were measured using ImageJ. Average ellipsoid cell volume was calculated using the formula, V = 3 4P abc where a, b, and c is equal to half the length, width and height (equal to width), respectively. Maximum cell division time was estimated by collecting cells every three hours from 03.30 to 21.30 from polyps 1.5–2 cm below the branch tips of three different Pocillopora colonies (genets) containing D. glynnii and three colonies containing C. latusorum in July 2007. Symbiont cells were isolated from host tissues with a pipette tip to remove and macerate 1–2 polyps. The slurry was placed in a 0.5 ml Eppendorf tube and fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde. Cell number and dividing cells (recorded as doublets and tetrads) were recorded with a haemocytometer (the cells in each of the three 10 μl sub-samples were counted). The mitotic index was calculated by dividing the number of dividing cells by the total cells present [39].

# The first reports that related differential colony mortality to the identity of the resident symbiont originated in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) following the 1997–1998 Tissue was removed from branch fragments representing each El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event when water of seven colonies containing C. latusorum and nine colonies with temperatures were 2–4°C warmer than historical average D. glynnii in July 2007 (colonies were from the established temperatures [1]. Pocillopora grandis colonies that hosted transects with known symbiont species). Durusdinium glynnii remained pigmented during this thermal anomaly and experienced little to no mortality, while colonies that bleached contained Cladocopium latusorum as did colonies of P. verrucosa (presumably) with Cladocopium pacificum [1,29]. This differential response to environmental stressors was later confirmed when 90% of P. grandis colony were measured using ImageJ. Average ellipsoid cell colonies containing C. latusorum and just 10% of colonies volume was calculated using the formula, with D. glynnii visibly bleached during cold-water events in V = 3 4P abc 2007 and 2008 [30,31]. Thus, the greater stress tolerance of colonies with D. glynnii mostly explains the relative dominance of this host–symbiont combination across the Eastern Pacific tropical and sub-tropical coasts of North and Central America [1,9,32,33].

The Eastern Pacific is an ideal study system to compare how different symbionts can affect the functionality of an ecologically dominant coral. Pocillopora grandis with either D. glynnii or C. latusorum, occur at similar depths and in many of the same habitats, with few colonies containing mixtures of each symbiont [9,34,35]. Here, the functional performance of both partnerships was studied under normal conditions and during a thermal stress experiment. Critical attributes of these mutualisms, including symbiont performance of both partnerships was studied under normal conditions and during a thermal stress experiment. Critical attributes of these mutualisms, including symbiont

# Symbiont densities estimation

Symbiont densities were estimated by removing tissue from 8 coral fragments (four fragments each for C. latusorum and D. glynnii) with a WaterPik and filtered seawater (0.4 μm) in July 2007. The tissue slurry volume was recorded, and symbiont cells were counted using a haemocytometer on a light microscope. The hot wax method was used to measure coral surface area. Total symbiont-to-host biomass ratios were calculated by multiplying the average symbiont cell volume by the average symbiont cell densities per host tissue area.

# Band-to-branch length measurement

Band-to-branch length was measured in June 2009 for all except 5 D. glynnii colonies. DNA was extracted and analyzed to identify symbiont species at the end of the experiment.

# Measurement of calyx cup dimensions

Five calices were randomly selected for measurement from colonies containing C. latusorum and D. glynnii. The maximum and minimum diameters of each calyx cup and the distance to the nearest calyx were measured using ImageJ.

# Relative colony fecundity

During July 2008, fragments from colonies with D. glynnii and C. latusorum were collected for analysis of relative colony fecundity.

# Host growth, calcification, linear extension, and calyx dimensions

One fragment per colony from colonies containing C. latusorum and colonies with D. glynnii were collected in May 2010 for measurements related to host growth, calcification, linear extension, and calyx dimensions.

# Experimental thermal stress and photophysiology

Tagged colonies containing latusorum and D. glynnii were subjected to experimental thermal stress and photophysiology analysis.

# Data analysis

Data analysis involved checking for normality, using various tests to compare different parameters, and analyzing the results of the experiments.

However, in the winter, the peak mitotic index increased significantly for C. latusorum while it was significantly decreased for D. glynnii to the extent that peak per cent cell division was higher for C. latusorum Proc.

# Results

(a) High prevalence of colonies housing thermally tolerant D. glynnii and rare detection of symbiont mixtures. Using three different sampling approaches, D. glynnii was most prevalent in a majority of P. grandis colonies (figure 1a–c). Differences in the prevalence of colonies with C. latusorum ranged from 6–34% which differed from location to location, mode of sampling, and year. Colonies with mixtures of each symbiont were typically rare (&le;5%), but highest in areas where colonies with C. latusorum were most common (approx. 15% of colonies; figure 1b). The co-occurrence of both host–symbiont pairing allowed for the comparison of their phenotypic and physiological attributes (figure 2a).

(b) Total volumes of the symbiont populations were generally equivalent for each host–symbiont combination The mean cell sizes (width and length) of D. glynnii were smaller than C. latusorum (figure 2b). The mean cell volumes calculated for D. glynnii were therefore significantly smaller than C. latusorum ( p &lt; 0.001) (table 1). Mean D. glynnii cell densities were greater than the cell densities of C. latusorum ( p = 0.006; figure 2c; table 1). The marked difference in cell volume when combined with cell density differences in the host, results in

(d) Oocyte size, not fecundity, differed among host–symbiont pairings Fecundity (figure 2e), estimated as the average number of gametes (oocytes and spermaries) per polyp, was similar between the superior (approx. 2 cm from tip) and inferior (6–8 cm from tip) positions of each coral branch examined regardless of the symbiont hosted ( p &gt; 0.31; table 1). Moreover, fecundity was similar between each host–symbiont combination ( p &gt; 0.1; figure 2f; table 1). Oocyte size ranges followed a bimodal distribution in all colonies (figure 2g), corresponding to different early stages in oocyte development (i.e. I–III) as well as for mature oocytes (stage IV). Colonies with C. latusorum had larger oocytes than colonies with D. glynnii ( p &lt; 0.001; figure 2g; table 1).

(e) Biomass increase, calcification rates, linear extension as well as calyx cup sizes and distance of separation were equivalent between host–symbiont pairings Mean buoyant weights of small out-planted experimental colonies increased 40% after 6 months and 260% after one year ( p &lt; 0.001). There was no statistical difference in weight gain between colonies with D. glynnii or C. latusorum ( p &gt; 0.93; figure 2h; table 1). Likewise, branches with either D. glynnii or C. latusorum calcified at the same rate ( p = 0.12; figure 2i; table 1) and branch linear extension of large adult colonies in situ was similar after eight months ( p = 0.17; figure 2j; table 1). Average calyx sizes between colonies with D. glynnii or C. latusorum were also similar ( p = 0.053) as was the distance between nearest calices ( p = 0.78; table 1; electronic supplementary material, figure S1).

(f) Colonies with D. glynnii tolerated high temperatures, while colonies with C. latusorum underwent photoinactivation No photophysiological differences were observed in the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), functional absorption cross section (σPSII) or rate of reoxidation (τ) in control or heat treatment colonies hosting D. glynnii ( p &gt; 0.2; figure 3a,b; table 2). These variables did not change in C. latusorum control colonies besides having slower reoxidation rates (τ) by day 6 of the experiment ( p &lt; 0.004; table 2). However, Fv/Fm declined significantly in heat-treated C. latusorum colonies beginning on day 3 of the experiment ( p = 0.01; table 2) and continued until day 7 ( p &lt; 0.001; table 2). The σPSII increased by day 3

# Figure 3. Differential response to thermal stress for each host–symbiont combination.

(a) Experimental design for a thermal stress experiment. Replicate fragments from each of 6 colonies with Durusdinium glynnii and 6 colonies with C. latusorum were divided into treatment tanks incrementally ramped to 32°C, and control tanks which remained at 26°C. Colonies were then monitored for 7 days.

(b) Colonies with D. glynnii exposed to 32°C exhibited no differences in photochemistry relative to controls (p > 0.2). By day 7, Fv/Fm decreased (p < 0.001), the functional absorption cross-section (σ) increased (p < 0.001), and the rate of reoxidation of the primary quinone acceptor –QA of PSII (τ) was slower (p = 0.002) for colonies with Cladocopium latusorum relative to controls. Darker colours represent controls and lighter exposed to 32°C.

(c) After 7 days at 32°C, peak mitotic indices for D. glynnii were significantly higher than for cells at control temperatures (p = 0.038), while the mean mitotic index for C. latusorum lowered significantly relative to controls (p = 0.004). All error bars and shaded regions represent one standard deviation.

|(i) Differences in seasonal acclimatization|Water temperatures and day length oscillate substantially between summer and winter in the Gulf of California. Changes in these physical conditions appear to differentially affect cell division rates of C. latusorum and D. glynnii. With each species having different thermal and light optima for growth, seasonal differences in resource availability likely influence cell proliferation. Additionally, differences between symbiont species in cell size and in hospite densities likely regulate their acquisition of inorganic nutrients, which may alter their physiological condition. However, while seasonal cell division differed between these symbionts, Pettay et al. and McGinley et al. found their intra-colony dominance remained stable in tagged colonies during and after thermal stress events. Most colonies are overwhelmingly dominated by one symbiont, with the other species often detected at trace levels (less than 1% of total symbiont cells in a colony). Not only does one symbiont species persist, this stability often extends to the symbiont’s genotype or clonal cell line. While rapid shifts in symbiont dominance sometimes occur in a subset of Pocillopora colonies (less than 5%), shifts were random, not favoring a particular symbiont over the other, and noted only after a stressful cold-water episode.|
|(ii) Differences in seasonal acclimatization|Water temperatures and day length oscillate substantially between summer and winter in the Gulf of California. Changes in these physical conditions appear to differentially affect cell division rates of C. latusorum and D. glynnii. With each species having different thermal and light optima for growth, seasonal differences in resource availability likely influence cell proliferation. Additionally, differences between symbiont species in cell size and in hospite densities likely regulate their acquisition of inorganic nutrients, which may alter their physiological condition.

(b) Functionally similar mutualisms differed by physiological stressors

While colonies representing each mutualism had similar growth and fecundity, they differed significantly in their response to high temperature, which was driven by the different physiological tolerances of each symbiont to thermal stress. D. glynnii appeared largely unaffected by short-term exposure to 32°C (figure 3b). Moreover, large increases in cell division rates suggested that cellular processes were enhanced at this temperature (figure 3c). By contrast, C. latusorum experienced photodamage as evidenced by the significant decline in PSII efficiency (Fv/FM), increased functional absorption cross-section, slower rate of electron transport (figure 3b) as well as a reduction in RNA transcripts for core photosystem reaction centre proteins [31]. These findings are consistent with the responses of each host–symbiont combination observed during natural episodes of thermal stress (figure 3d) where D. glynnii cell densities remained unchanged in colonies exposed to thermal stress, whereas affected colonies with C. latusorum experienced significant cell losses [9,63]. Indeed, in places across the Pacific Ocean, pocilloporid and montiporid colonies with D. glynnii tend to bleach less and experience lower mortality than colonies hosting Cladocopium spp. [1,9,10,30]. Differential mortality over the course of numerous thermal anomalies in the Eastern Pacific since the early 1980s may largely explain why there are far fewer colonies with C. latusorum in the region compared to those with D. glynnii [1,9,64].

It is long established that Durusdinium mutualisms are better at tolerating stressful environmental conditions (i.e. marine heat waves). Colonies harbouring them often thrive under environmental conditions deemed suboptimal for many reef corals [6,25,61,65–67]. Continued mutualistic functioning under high temperatures, for example, imparts greater stability to the mutualism as a whole. Despite this, there are few known attributes, genetic or physiological, that explain the stress tolerance of these symbionts. Recent evidence attributes Durusdinium thermal tolerance to increased nitrogen assimilation at higher temperatures [14], as well as saturation in specific lipids known for stabilizing PSII structure (e.g. sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerols, SQDGs) and stabilizing thylakoid membranes by increasing the monogalactosyl diacylglycerol and digalactosyl diacylglycerol ratio (DGDG: MGDG) [68]. Smaller D. glynnii cell volume probably enhances nutrient acquisition and therefore cell growth, which may contribute to its thermal tolerance and population maintenance in hospite [69,70], but a complete understanding of the underlying cellular and biochemical mechanisms responsible for thermal tolerance in D. glynnii remains incomplete.

(c) Not all corals with thermally tolerant symbionts have significant physiological tradeoffs

Our results as well as those from other studies indicate that colonies hosting D. glynnii do not exhibit significant metabolic tradeoffs in exchange for increased thermal tolerance (figure 2) [19,20]. Colonies with D. glynnii in the Eastern Pacific are highly abundant with sizes reaching 1–3 m across. Compared to Pocillopora colonies typical in other regions of the central and west Pacific, the robust growth and unusual colony size indicate that this mutualism is well adapted to the region’s environment (figure 1; personal observation). The adaptive radiation of Durusdinium in the Indo-West Pacific during the Pleistocene led to the evolution of numerous ecologically specialized species like D. glynnii that maintain stable associations with specific host taxa [11,25,65]. Moreover, facilitated by vertical transmission, pocilloporid corals share a close evolutionary history with their symbionts, which further explains their high-functioning mutualism with D. glynnii [26,71]. These evolutionary factors reconcile the present findings with previous reports of significant growth trade-offs among corals with thermally tolerant symbionts [15–17].

Previous reports of growth tradeoffs are context dependent and possibly explained by different factors, including the geographical location and species identity of the Durusdinium under study. Juvenile Acropora colonies experienced almost 50% reduced growth (measured as the number of new polyps added over time) when associated with Durusdinium sp. on the Great Barrier Reef [16]. Moreover, adult colonies had 25–30% fewer lipid stores and smaller oocytes than colonies harbouring Cladocopium spp. [17]. Lower rates of translocated photosynthate accounts for the reduced growth.

low energy reserves and smaller oocyte sizes measured in these GBR Acropora colonies [15]. The Acropora-Durusdinium combinations found on the GBR are rare, however, and occur in the most marginal of reef habitats [15–17,72,73], indicating that the environments of this reef system do not readily support mutualisms involving this genus of symbiont. Similarly, Caribbean Orbicella colonies hosting Durusdinium trenchii exhibit approximately 50% lower calcification rates ([18], but see also [74]), have lower tissue biomass, and fewer nutrient reserves (D. W. Kemp 2023, personal communication). However, D. trenchii is a non-native species recently introduced from the Indo-Pacific [18]. Ultimately, earlier characterizations of poor growth seem to relate to rare or introduced species of Durusdinium, representing maladapted mutualisms lacking a coevolutionary history.

Arguably, physiological performance is expected to be optimized in host corals like Pocillopora which have coevolved for hundreds of thousands to millions of years with symbionts in the genus Durusdinium [25]. As research expands to more tropical warm-water regions of the Indo-Pacific, these host–symbiont pairings do not appear to experience reduced translocation or calcification (D. W. Kemp et al. 2023, unpublished data). D. glynnii in Pocillopora supports high rates of photosynthesis per cell and maintains carbon translocation under higher temperature [23]. Indeed, a clearer understanding of the natural history of reef corals and their symbionts, including the discernment of closely related symbiont species, is necessary to better explain physiological and ecological patterns and processes.

# Host dependency on co-evolved symbionts in a changing climate

These findings provide insight into the persistence of reef corals as oceans continue to warm and marine heat waves increase in frequency [75,76]. Because certain symbiont species raise the thermal tolerance of host corals by 1–2°C, different host–symbiont partner combinations induce phenotypic change faster than evolutionary adaptation. This ecological response is limited by partner specificity and symbiont availability [6,77–79], however, many stress-tolerant symbionts, including D. glynnii, are widespread throughout the Indo-Pacific [65,66]. In some mutualisms, harboring symbionts with physiological adaptations that allow tolerance to high temperatures can result in metabolic tradeoffs affecting colony growth and fitness. By contrast, the physiological integration between co-evolved mutualisms, like Pocillopora and D. glynnii, creates fast-growing, highly fecund, colonies with few observable trade-offs. The larger implications of these findings are numerous. Increased prevalence of these mutualisms under higher or more variable ocean temperatures may continue to support ecosystem productivity and contribute to reef growth [33]. Future comprehensive analyses, such as the present case study, will offer better insights into the functional ecology of coral–dinoflagellate mutualisms and how partner diversity in these relationships creates important variation critical in their responses to climate change.
